# Comparing Azure Rights Management and AD RMS
If you know or have previously deployed Active Directory Rights Management Services (AD RMS), you might be wondering how [!INCLUDE[aad_rightsmanagement_1](../Token/aad_rightsmanagement_1_md.md)] (Azure RMS) compares in terms of functionality and requirements. Use the following table for a side-by-side comparison of the features and benefits of Azure RMS and AD RMS. If you have security-specific comparison questions, see the [Cryptographic controls for signing and encryption](../Topic/Comparing-Azure-Rights-Management-and-AD-RMS.md#BKMK_CryptographicControls) section in this topic.

> [!NOTE]
> To make this comparison easier, some information here is repeated from [Requirements for Azure Rights Management](../Topic/Requirements-for-Azure-Rights-Management.md). Use that topic for more specific support and version information for [!INCLUDE[aad_rightsmanagement_1](../Token/aad_rightsmanagement_1_md.md)].

|Provides two default rights policy templates that restrict access of the content to your own organization; one that provides read-only viewing of protected content and another template that provides write or modify permissions for the protected content.<br /><br />You can also create your own custom templates, which includes departmental templates that are visible to only a subset of users. For more information, see [Configuring Custom Templates for Azure Rights Management](../Topic/Configuring-Custom-Templates-for-Azure-Rights-Management.md).<br /><br />In addition, users can define their own set of permissions if the templates are not sufficient.|There are no default rights policy templates; you must create and then distribute these.

## <a name="BKMK_CryptographicControls"></a>Cryptographic controls for signing and encryption
[!INCLUDE[aad_rightsmanagement_1](../Token/aad_rightsmanagement_1_md.md)] always uses RSA 2048 for all public key cryptography and SHA 256 for signing operations. In comparison, AD RMS supports RSA 1024 and RSA 2048, and SHA 1 or SHA 256 for signing operations.

Both [!INCLUDE[aad_rightsmanagement_1](../Token/aad_rightsmanagement_1_md.md)] and AD RMS use AES 128 for symmetric encryption.

[!INCLUDE[aad_rightsmanagement_1](../Token/aad_rightsmanagement_1_md.md)] is compliant with FIPS 140-2 when your tenant key is created and managed by Microsoft (the default), or if you manage your own tenant key (known as BYOK). For more information about managing your tenant key, see [Planning and Implementing Your Azure Rights Management Tenant Key](../Topic/Planning-and-Implementing-Your-Azure-Rights-Management-Tenant-Key.md).
