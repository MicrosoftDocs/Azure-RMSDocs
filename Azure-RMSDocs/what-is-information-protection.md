# What is Azure Information Protection?

>***Applies to**: [Azure Information Protection](/office365/servicedescriptions/microsoft-365-service-descriptions/microsoft-365-tenantlevel-services-licensing-guidance/microsoft-365-security-compliance-licensing-guidance#information-protection)*
>

> [!NOTE]
> Are you looking for [Microsoft Information Protection](/microsoft-365/compliance/information-protection)? The Azure Information Protection unified labeling client is [currently in maintenance mode](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/security-compliance-and-identity/announcing-aip-unified-labeling-client-maintenance-mode-and/ba-p/3043613). We recommend enabling Microsoft Information Protection's built-in labeling for your Office 365 applications. For more information, see the [sensitivity labeling documentation from Microsoft 365](/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels#sensitivity-labels-and-azure-information-protection).

Azure Information Protection (AIP) is a cloud-based solution that enables organizations to discover, classify, and protect documents and emails by applying labels to content.

AIP is part of the Microsoft Information Protection (MIP) solution, and extends the [labeling](/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels) and [classification](/microsoft-365/compliance/data-classification-overview) functionality provided by Microsoft 365.

The following image shows the Azure Information Protection additions to MIP, including the [**unified labeling client**](#aip-unified-labeling-client), [**scanner**](#aip-on-premises-scanner), and [**SDK**](#microsoft-information-protection-sdk).

:::image type="content" source="media/what-is-mip.png" alt-text="The Azure Information Protection areas of the Microsoft Information Protection framework":::

Microsoft Information Protection is the common information protection stack that's leveraged by AIP's unified labeling client. For more information, see the [Microsoft 365 documentation](/microsoft-365/compliance/protect-information).

## AIP unified labeling client

The Azure Information Protection unified labeling client extends labeling, classification, and protection capabilities to additional file types, as well as to the File Explorer and PowerShell. 

For example, in the File Explorer, right-click one or more files and select **Classify and protect** to manage the AIP functionality on the selected files.

:::image type="content" source="media/protect-from-file-explorer.png" alt-text="Classify and protect from the File Explorer":::


Download the client from the [Microsoft Azure Information Protection download page](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=53018).
    
## AIP on-premises scanner

The Azure Information Protection on-premises scanner enables administrators to scan their on-premises file repositories for sensitive content that must be labeled, classified, and/or protected.

The on-premises scanner is installed using PowerShell cmdlets provided as part of the unified labeling client, and can be managed using PowerShell and the Azure Information Protection area in the Azure portal.

For example, use the scanner data shown on the Azure portal to find repositories on your network that might have sensitive content at risk:

For more information, see:

- [What is the AIP unified labeling scanner?](deploy-aip-scanner.md)
- The scanner sections of the [AIP unified labeling client - Version release history](rms-client/unifiedlabelingclient-version-release-history.md)

Download the scanner installation together with the client from the [Microsoft Azure Information Protection download page](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=53018).


## Microsoft Information Protection SDK

The Microsoft Information Protection SDK extends sensitivity labels to third-party apps and services. Developers can use the SDK to build built-in support for applying labels and protection to files.

For example, you might use the MIP SDK for:

- A line-of-business application that applies classification labels to files on export.
- A CAD/CAM design application provides built-in support for Microsoft Information Protection labeling.
- A cloud access security broker or data loss prevention solution reasons over data encrypted with Azure Information Protection.

For more information, see the [Microsoft Information Protection SDK overview](/information-protection/develop/overview).

## AIP's classic client

The Azure Information Protection classic client is the earlier version of AIP, and enables administrators to manage classification labels directly in the Azure portal.

AIP labels managed in the Azure portal are *not* supported by the unified labeling platform, are limited to working with the Azure Information Protection client and scanner, and Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps. 

We recommend migrating to unified labeling to support these features, as well as SharePoint, Microsoft 365 apps, Outlook for the web and mobile devices, PowerBI data protection, and more. For more information, see [Tutorial: Migrating from the Azure Information Protection (AIP) classic client to the unified labeling client](tutorial-migrating-to-ul.md).
