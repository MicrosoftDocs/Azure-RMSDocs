# What is Azure Information Protection?

[!INCLUDE [looking-for-mip](includes/looking-for-mip.md)]

Azure Information Protection (AIP) is part of **Microsoft Purview Information Protection** (formerly Microsoft Information Protection or MIP). Microsoft Purview Information Protection helps you discover, classify, protect, and govern sensitive information wherever it lives or travels.

AIP extends the [labeling](/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels) and [classification](/microsoft-365/compliance/data-classification-overview) functionality provided by Microsoft Purview with the following capabilities:

- The [**unified labeling client**](#aip-unified-labeling-client)
- An on-premises [**scanner**](#on-premises-scanner)
- The [**SDK**](#microsoft-information-protection-sdk)

AIP also provides the encryption service, [Azure Rights Management](what-is-azure-rms.md), that's used by Microsoft Purview Information Protection.

For a comprehensive list of capabilities from Microsoft Purview Information Protection, see [Protect your sensitive data with Microsoft Purview](/microsoft-365/compliance/information-protection).

## AIP unified labeling client

The Azure Information Protection unified labeling client extends labeling, classification, and protection capabilities to additional file types, as well as to File Explorer and PowerShell.

For example, in File Explorer, right-click one or more files and select **Classify and protect** to manage the AIP functionality on the selected files.

Download the client from the [Microsoft Azure Information Protection download page](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=53018).
    
## On-premises scanner

The on-premises scanner enables administrators to scan their on-premises file repositories for sensitive content that must be labeled, classified, and/or protected.

The on-premises scanner is installed using PowerShell cmdlets provided as part of the unified labeling client, and can be managed using PowerShell and the information protection scanner area in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.

For example, configure the content scan job setting for the on-premises scanner within the Microsoft Purview compliance portal:

:::image type="content" source="media/information-protection-scanner.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to configure content scan jobs on information protection scanner." lightbox="media/information-protection-scanner.png":::

For more information, see:

- [Learn about the information protection scanner](/microsoft-365/compliance/deploy-scanner)
- The scanner sections of the [AIP unified labeling client - Version release history](rms-client/unifiedlabelingclient-version-release-history.md)

Download the scanner installation together with the client from the [Microsoft Azure Information Protection download page](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=53018).


## Microsoft Information Protection SDK

The Microsoft Information Protection SDK extends sensitivity labels to third-party apps and services. Developers can use the SDK to build built-in support for applying labels and protection to files.

For example, you might use the MIP SDK for:

- A line-of-business application that applies sensitivity labels to files on export.
- A CAD/CAM design application that provides support for built-in labeling.
- A cloud access security broker or data loss prevention solution that reasons over data encrypted with Azure Information Protection.

For more information, see the [Microsoft Information Protection SDK overview](/information-protection/develop/overview).
