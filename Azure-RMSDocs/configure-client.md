# Azure Information Protection client: Installation and configuration for clients

[!INCLUDE [looking-for-mip](includes/looking-for-mip.md)]

The AIP unified labeling client installs an Office add-in that enables users to easily label and protect documents directly from the Office ribbon. 

The client also offers:

- Labeling and protection for file types that are not supported by the built-in protection service (Azure Rights Management).
- A viewer for protected files that can't be opened by Office apps. There's a similar viewer for iOS and Android.
- Features for tracking and revoking access to protected files.

## The Azure Information Protection client for Windows: Installation and configuration

For an enterprise installation and configuration of the client for Windows, see the [Azure Information Protection unified labeling client administrator guide](./rms-client/clientv2-admin-guide.md).

If you want to quickly install and test these clients for a single computer, see [Download and install the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client](./rms-client/install-unifiedlabelingclient-app.md).

## The Azure Information Protection app for iOS and Android: Installation and management

To install the Azure Information Protection app viewer for iOS and Android, use the links on the [Microsoft Azure Information Protection page](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=303970). No configuration is required.

> [!NOTE]
> For Mac computers, links from this page download the RMS sharing app. These computers do not support the Azure Information Protection client.

### Integration with Intune

Because the Azure Information Protection viewer app uses the Microsoft Intune App Software Development Kit, when iOS and Android devices are enrolled by Intune, you can deploy and manage the Azure Information Protection viewer app for these devices:

1. [Add the Azure Information Protection app to Intune](/intune/apps/apps-add)

2. Do one or both of the following actions:

    - Deploy the app by [assigning it to users](/intune/apps/apps-deploy)

    - Manage the app by using [app protection policies](/intune/apps/app-protection-policies)

Additional information for when you add the Azure Information Protection app to Intune:

- **For iOS**: Search for and add the app from Intune.

- **For Android**: When you add the app, use the following **Google Play URL**:

    ```md
    https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.ipviewer
    ```

## Next steps

After you have installed and configured Azure Information Protection clients, you might need to learn more about how the client interprets the different usage rights that can be used to protect documents and emails. For more information, see [Configuring usage rights for Azure Information Management](configure-usage-rights.md).
