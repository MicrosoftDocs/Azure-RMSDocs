# Prerequisites for installing and deploying the Azure Information Protection classic scanner

>***Applies to**: Azure Information Protection, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2*
>
>***Relevant for**: [Azure Information Protection classic client for Windows](faqs.md#whats-the-difference-between-the-azure-information-protection-classic-and-unified-labeling-clients). For the unified labeling scanner, see the [unified labeling scanner prerequisites](deploy-aip-scanner-prereqs.md)*

[!INCLUDE [AIP classic client is sunset](includes/classic-client-sunset.md)]

Before installing the Azure Information Protection on-premises scanner, make sure that your system complies with basic [Azure Information Protection requirements](requirements.md), as well as the following requirements specific to the scanner:

- [Windows Server requirements](#windows-server-requirements)
- [Service account requirements](#service-account-requirements)
- [SQL server requirements](#sql-server-requirements)
- [Azure Information Protection client requirements](#azure-information-protection-client-requirements)
- [Label configuration requirements](#label-configuration-requirements)
- [SharePoint requirements](#sharepoint-requirements)
- [Microsoft Office requirements](#microsoft-office-requirements)
- [File path requirements](#file-path-requirements)

If you can't meet all the requirements in the table because they are prohibited by your organization policies, see the [alternative configurations](#deploying-the-scanner-with-alternative-configurations) section.

When deploying the scanner in production or testing the performance for multiple scanners, see [Storage requirements and capacity planning for SQL Server](#storage-requirements-and-capacity-planning-for-sql-server).

When you're ready to start installing and deploying your scanner, continue with [Deploying the Azure Information Protection scanner to automatically classify and protect files](deploy-aip-scanner-configure-install-classic.md).

## Windows Server requirements

You must have a Windows Server computer to run the scanner, which has the following system specifications:

|Specification  |Details  |
|---------|---------|
|**Processor**     |4 core processors         |
|**RAM**     |8 GB         |
|**Disk space**     |10 GB free space (average) for temporary files. </br></br>The scanner requires sufficient disk space to create temporary files for each file that it scans, four files per core. </br></br>The recommended disk space of 10 GB allows for 4 core processors scanning 16 files that each have a file size of 625 MB. 
|**Operating system**     |- Windows Server 2019 </br>- Windows Server 2016 </br>- Windows Server 2012 R2 </br></br>**Note**: For testing or evaluation purposes in a non-production environment, you can also use any Windows operating system that is [supported by the Azure Information Protection client](requirements.md#client-devices).
|**Network connectivity**     | Your scanner computer can be a physical or virtual computer with a fast and reliable network connection to the data stores to be scanned. </br></br> If internet connectivity is not possible because of your organization policies, see [Deploying the scanner with alternative configurations](#deploying-the-scanner-with-alternative-configurations). </br></br>Otherwise, make sure that this computer has internet connectivity that allows the following URLs over HTTPS (port 443):</br><br />-  \*.aadrm.com <br />-  \*.azurerms.com<br />-  \*.informationprotection.azure.com <br /> - informationprotection.hosting.portal.azure.net <br /> - \*.aria.microsoft.com|
| ||

## Service account requirements

You must have a service account to run the scanner service on the Windows Server computer, as well as authenticate to Azure AD and download the Azure Information Protection Policy.

Your service account must be an Active Directory account and synchronized to Azure AD.

If you cannot synchronize this account because of your organization policies, see [Deploying the scanner with alternative configurations](#deploying-the-scanner-with-alternative-configurations).

This service account has the following requirements:

|Requirement  |Details  |
|---------|---------|
|**Log on locally** user right assignment     |Required to install and configure the scanner, but not required to run scans.  </br></br>Once you've confirmed that the scanner can discover, classify, and protect files, you can remove this right from the service account.  </br></br>If granting this right even for a short period of time is not possible because of your organization policies, see [Deploying the scanner with alternative configurations](#deploying-the-scanner-with-alternative-configurations).         |
|**Log on as a service** user right assignment.     |  This right is automatically granted to the service account during the scanner installation and this right is required for the installation, configuration, and operation of the scanner.        |
|**Permissions to the data repositories**     |- **File shares or local files**: Grant **Read**, **Write**, and **Modify** permissions for scanning the files and then applying classification and protection as configured.  <br /><br />- **SharePoint**: Grant **Full Control** permissions for scanning the files and then applying classification and protection as configured.  <br /><br />- **Discovery mode**: To run the scanner in discovery mode only, **Read** permission is sufficient.         |
|**For labels that reprotect or remove protection**     | To ensure that the scanner always has access to protected files, make this account a [super user](configure-super-users.md) for Azure Information Protection, and ensure that the super user feature is enabled. </br></br>Additionally, if you've implemented [onboarding controls](activate-service.md#configuring-onboarding-controls-for-a-phased-deployment) for a phased deployment, make sure that the service account is included in the onboarding controls you've configured.|
| ||

## SQL server requirements

To store the scanner configuration data, use an SQL server with the following requirements:

- **A local or remote instance.**

    We recommend hosting the SQL server and the scanner service on different machines, unless you're working with a small deployment. Additionally, we recommend having a dedicated SQL instance that serves the scanner database only, and that is not shared with other applications.

    If you're working on a shared server, make sure that the [recommended number of cores](#windows-server-requirements) are free for the scanner database to work.

    SQL Server 2012 is the minimum version for the following editions:

    - SQL Server Enterprise
    - SQL Server Standard
    - SQL Server Express (recommended for test environments only)

- **An account with Sysadmin role to install the scanner.**

    This enables the installation process to automatically create the scanner configuration database and grant the required **db_owner** role to the service account that runs the scanner. 

    If you cannot be granted the Sysadmin role or your organization policies require databases to be created and configured manually, see [Deploying the scanner with alternative configurations](#deploying-the-scanner-with-alternative-configurations).

- **Capacity.** For capacity guidance, see [Storage requirements and capacity planning for SQL Server](#storage-requirements-and-capacity-planning-for-sql-server).

- **[Case insensitive collation](/sql/relational-databases/collations/collation-and-unicode-support).**

> [!NOTE]
> Multiple configuration databases on the same SQL server are supported when you specify a custom cluster (profile) name for the scanner.
> 

### Storage requirements and capacity planning for SQL Server

The amount of disk space required for the scanner's configuration database and the specification of the computer running SQL Server can vary for each environment, so we encourage you to do your own testing. Use the following guidance as a starting point.

For more information, see [Optimizing the performance of the scanner](deploy-aip-scanner-configure-install-classic.md#optimizing-scanner-performance).

The disk size for the configuration database will vary for each deployment. We recommend that you allocate 500 MB for every 1,000,000 files that you want to scan. 

For each scanner, use:

- 4 core processors
- 8 GB RAM (4 GB minimum)

## Azure Information Protection client requirements

You must have the Azure Information Protection client installed on the Windows Server computer.

For more information, see the [Classic client admin guide](./rms-client/client-admin-guide.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must install the full client for the scanner. Do not install the client with just the PowerShell module.
> 

## Label configuration requirements

You must have labels configured that automatically apply classification, and optionally, protection.

If you don't have these labels configured, see [Deploying the scanner with alternative configurations](#deploying-the-scanner-with-alternative-configurations).

For more information, see:

- [How to configure conditions for automatic and recommended classification](configure-policy-classification.md)
- [How to configure a label for Rights Management protection](configure-policy-protection.md)

> [!TIP] 
> Use the instructions from the [tutorial](infoprotect-quick-start-tutorial.md) to test the scanner with a label that looks for credit card numbers in a prepared Word document. However, you will need to change the label configuration so that the option **Select how this label is applied** is set to **Automatic**, rather than **Recommended** or **treat recommended labeling as automatic** (available in scanner version 2.7.x.x and above). 
>
> Then remove the label from the document (if it is applied) and copy the file to a data repository for the scanner. 

## SharePoint requirements

To scan SharePoint document libraries and folders, ensure that your SharePoint server complies with the following requirements:

- **Supported versions.** Supported versions include: SharePoint 2019, SharePoint 2016, and SharePoint 2013. Other versions of SharePoint are not supported for the scanner.

- **Versioning.** When you use [versioning](/sharepoint/governance/versioning-content-approval-and-check-out-planning), the scanner inspects and labels the last published version. If the scanner labels a file and [content approval](/sharepoint/governance/versioning-content-approval-and-check-out-planning#plan-content-approval) is required, that labeled file must be approved to be available for users.  

- **Large SharePoint farms.** For large SharePoint farms, check whether you need to increase the list view threshold (by default, 5,000) for the scanner to access all files. For more information, see [Manage large lists and libraries in SharePoint](https://support.office.com/article/manage-large-lists-and-libraries-in-sharepoint-b8588dae-9387-48c2-9248-c24122f07c59#__bkmkchangelimit&ID0EAABAAA=Server).


## Microsoft Office requirements

To scan Office documents, your documents must be in one of the following formats:

- Microsoft Office 97-2003 
- Office Open XML formats for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint

For more information, see [File types supported by the Azure Information Protection client](./rms-client/client-admin-guide-file-types.md).

## File path requirements

To scan files, your file paths must have a maximum of 260 characters, unless the scanner is installed on Windows 2016 and the computer is configured to support long paths

Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 support path lengths greater than 260 characters with the following [group policy setting](/archive/blogs/jeremykuhne/net-4-6-2-and-long-paths-on-windows-10): **Local Computer Policy** > **Computer Configuration** > **Administrative Templates** > **All Settings** > **Enable Win32 long paths**

For more information about supporting long file paths, see the [Maximum Path Length Limitation](/windows/desktop/FileIO/naming-a-file#maximum-path-length-limitation) section from the Windows 10 developer documentation.

## Deploying the scanner with alternative configurations

The prerequisites listed above are the default requirements for the scanner deployment, and recommended because they support the simplest scanner configuration.

The default requirements should be suitable for initial testing, so that you can check the capabilities of the scanner. 

However, in a production environment, your organization's policies may prohibit these default requirements. The scanner can accommodate the following restrictions with additional configuration:

- [The scanner server cannot have internet connectivity](#restriction-the-scanner-server-cannot-have-internet-connectivity)

- [Restriction: The scanner service account cannot be synchronized to Azure Active Directory but the server has internet connectivity](#restriction-the-scanner-service-account-cannot-be-synchronized-to-azure-active-directory-but-the-server-has-internet-connectivity)

- [Restriction: The service account for the scanner cannot be granted the **Log on locally** right](#restriction-the-service-account-for-the-scanner-cannot-be-granted-the-log-on-locally-right)

- [Restriction: You cannot be granted Sysadmin or databases must be created and configured manually](#restriction-you-cannot-be-granted-sysadmin-or-databases-must-be-created-and-configured-manually)

- [Restriction: Your labels do not have auto-labeling conditions](#restriction-your-labels-do-not-have-auto-labeling-conditions)

### Restriction: The scanner server cannot have internet connectivity

To support a disconnected computer, perform the following steps:

1. Configure your labels that apply classification only, or apply protection that uses [HYOK protection](configure-adrms-restrictions.md). 

    Without an internet connection, the scanner cannot apply protection, remove protection, or inspect protected files by using your organization's cloud-based key. Instead, the scanner is limited to using labels that apply classification only, or apply protection that uses HYOK protection.
    
    For more information, see [Support for disconnected computers](./rms-client/client-admin-guide-customizations.md#support-for-disconnected-computers).

1. Configure the scanner in the Azure portal, by creating a scanner cluster. If you need help with this step, see [Configure the scanner in the Azure portal](deploy-aip-scanner-configure-install-classic.md#configure-the-scanner-in-the-azure-portal).

2. Export your content job from the **Azure Information Protection - Content scan jobs** pane using the **Export** option.

3. In a PowerShell session, run [Import-AIPScannerConfiguration](/powershell/module/azureinformationprotection/Import-AIPScannerConfiguration) and specify the file that contains the exported settings.

### Restriction: You cannot be granted Sysadmin or databases must be created and configured manually

If you can be granted the Sysadmin role *temporarily* to install the scanner, you can remove this role when the scanner installation is complete.

Do one of the following, depending on your organization's requirements:

- **You can have the Sysadmin role temporarily.** If you temporarily have the Sysadmin role, the database is automatically created for you and the service account for the scanner is automatically granted the required permissions.

    However, the user account that configures the scanner still requires the **db_owner** role for the scanner configuration database. If you only have the Sysadmin role until the scanner installation is complete, [grant the db_owner role to the user account manually](#create-a-user-and-grant-db_owner-rights-manually).

- **You cannot have the Sysadmin role at all.** If you cannot be granted the Sysadmin role even temporarily, you must ask a user with Sysadmin rights to manually create a database before you install the scanner. 

    For this configuration, the **db_owner** role must be assigned to the following accounts: 

    - Service account for the scanner

    - User account for the scanner installation

    - User account for scanner configuration
      
    Typically, you will use the same user account to install and configure the scanner. If you use different accounts, they both require the db_owner role for the scanner configuration database. Create this user and rights as needed. 

    If you do not specify your own cluster (profile) name for the scanner, the configuration database is named **AIPScanner_\<computer_name>**. </br>Continue with [creating a user and granting db_owner rights on the database](#create-a-user-and-grant-db_owner-rights-manually). 

Additionally:

- You must be a local administrator on the server that will run the scanner
- The service account that will run the scanner must be granted Full Control permissions to the following registry keys:
    
    - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\MSIPC\Server
    - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MSIPC\Server

If, after configuring these permissions, you see an error when you install the scanner, the error can be ignored and you can manually start the scanner service.

#### Populate the database manually

Populate the database using the following script: 

```sql
if not exists(select * from master.sys.server_principals where sid = SUSER_SID('domain\user')) BEGIN declare @T nvarchar(500) Set @T = 'CREATE LOGIN ' + quotename('domain\user') + ' FROM WINDOWS ' exec(@T) END 
```

#### Create a user and grant db_owner rights manually

To create a user and grant db_owner rights on this database, ask the Sysadmin to do the following:

1. Create a DB for scanner:

    ```sql
    **CREATE DATABASE AIPScannerUL_[clustername]**
    
    **ALTER DATABASE AIPScannerUL_[clustername] SET TRUSTWORTHY ON**
    ```
    
2. Grant rights to the user that runs the install command and is used to run scanner management commands.

    SQL script:
    
    ```sql
    if not exists(select * from master.sys.server_principals where sid = SUSER_SID('domain\user')) BEGIN declare @T nvarchar(500) Set @T = 'CREATE LOGIN ' + quotename('domain\user') + ' FROM WINDOWS ' exec(@T) END
    USE DBName IF NOT EXISTS (select * from sys.database_principals where sid = SUSER_SID('domain\user')) BEGIN declare @X nvarchar(500) Set @X = 'CREATE USER ' + quotename('domain\user') + ' FROM LOGIN ' + quotename('domain\user'); exec sp_addrolemember 'db_owner', 'domain\user' exec(@X) END
    ```

3. Grant rights to scanner service account.

    SQL script:

    ```sql
    if not exists(select * from master.sys.server_principals where sid = SUSER_SID('domain\user')) BEGIN declare @T nvarchar(500) Set @T = 'CREATE LOGIN ' + quotename('domain\user') + ' FROM WINDOWS ' exec(@T) END
    ```

#### Restriction: The service account for the scanner cannot be granted the **Log on locally** right

If your organization policies prohibit the **Log on locally** right for service accounts, but allows the **Log on as a batch job** right, see [Specify and use the Token parameter for Set-AIPAuthentication](./rms-client/client-admin-guide-powershell.md#specify-and-use-the-token-parameter-for-set-aipauthentication).

#### Restriction: The scanner service account cannot be synchronized to Azure Active Directory but the server has internet connectivity

You can have one account to run the scanner service and use another account to authenticate to Azure Active Directory:

- **For the scanner service account**, use a local Windows account or an Active Directory account.

- **For the Azure Active Directory account**, [specify and use the Token parameter for Set-AIPAuthentication](./rms-client/client-admin-guide-powershell.md#specify-and-use-the-token-parameter-for-set-aipauthentication).

#### Restriction: Your labels do not have auto-labeling conditions

If your labels do not have any auto-labeling conditions, plan to use one of the following options when configuring your scanner:

|Option  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Discover all info types**     |  In your [content scan job](deploy-aip-scanner-configure-install.md#create-a-content-scan-job), set the **Info types to be discovered** option to **All**. </br></br>This option sets the content scan job to scan your content for all sensitive information types.      |
|**Define a default label**     |   Define a default label in your [policy](/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels#what-label-policies-can-do), [content scan job](deploy-aip-scanner-configure-install.md#create-a-content-scan-job), or [repository](deploy-aip-scanner-configure-install.md#apply-a-default-label-to-all-files-in-a-data-repository). </br></br>In this case the scanner applies the default label on all files found.       |
| | |
