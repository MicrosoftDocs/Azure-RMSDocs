# Removed and deprecated services

This article describes the current status for removed and deprecated services that you may have used, or may still be using with Azure Information Protection.

## The AIP classic client

To provide a unified and streamlined customer experience, the **Azure Information Protection classic client** and **labeling management** pages in the Azure portal are deprecated as of **March 31, 2021**. No further support is provided for the classic client, and maintenance versions will no longer be released.

The classic client will be officially retired, and will stop functioning, on **March 31, 2022**. At this point, the **Labels** and **Policies** tabs will be removed from the Azure portal, and the classic client will not longer be able to acquire policies from the Azure portal.

We recommend that all customers migrate to unified labeling, and enable [built-in sensitivity labeling for Office applications](/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels).

For more information, see:

## AIP and legacy Windows and Office, SharePoint, and Exchange versions

- [Windows 7 extended supported ended on January 14, 2020](/lifecycle/products/windows-7).

    We strongly encourage you to upgrade to a newer version of Windows.

    However, if you have Extended Security Updates (ESU) and a support contract, AIP support is available to continue keeping your Windows 7 systems secure.

    For more information, check with your support contact.

- [Office 2010](/lifecycle/products/microsoft-office-2010) and [Exchange Server 2010](/lifecycle/products/exchange-server-2010) extended support ended on October 13, 2020.

    This support will not be extended, and ESU will not be offered for Office 2010.

    We strongly encourage you to upgrade to a newer version of Office 365.

- [SharePoint Server 2010 extended support ended on April 13, 2021](/lifecycle/products/microsoft-sharepoint-server-2010).
