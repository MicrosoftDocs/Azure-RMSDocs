# Office apps: Configuration for clients to use the Azure Rights Management service


Use this information to determine what you need to do so that Office apps work with the Azure Rights Management service from Azure Information Protection.

## MicrosoftÂ 365 apps, Office 2021, Office 2019, Office 2016, and Office 2013

Because these later versions of Office provide built-in support for the Azure Rights Management service, no client computer configuration is required to support the information rights management (IRM) features for applications such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Outlook on the web. 

All users have to do for these apps on Windows, is sign in to their Office applications with their Microsoft 365 credentials. They can then can protect files and emails, and use files and emails that have been protected by others.

### User instructions for Office for Mac

Users who have Office for Mac must first verify their credentials before they can protect content. For example:

1. Open Outlook and create a profile by using your Microsoft 365 work or school account. 

2. Create a new message and on the **Options** tab, select **Permissions**, and then select **Verify Credentials**. When prompted, specify your Microsoft 365 work or school account details again, and select **Sign in**.
    
    This action downloads the Azure Rights Management templates and **Verify Credentials** is now replaced with options that include **No Restrictions**, **Do Not Forward**, and any Azure Rights Management templates that are published for your tenant. 

3. You can now cancel this new message.

4. To protect an email message or a document: On the **Options** tab, select **Permissions** and choose an option or template that protects your email or document.

For more information, see [Azure Information Protection client: Installation and configuration for clients](configure-client.md).
