# Getting started with tenant root keys

[!INCLUDE [looking-for-mip](includes/looking-for-mip.md)]

After [planning, creating, and configuring your tenant key](plan-implement-tenant-key.md) as needed, continue with the following steps:

- [Start using your tenant key](#start-using-your-tenant-key)
- [Consider usage logging](#consider-usage-logging)

For more information about the life-cycle operations supported for your tenant key, see [Operations for your Azure Information Protection tenant key](./operations-tenant-key.md).

If your organization requires on-premises protection for highly sensitive content, configure [DKE protection](plan-implement-tenant-key.md#double-key-encryption-dke) (unified labeling client only).

## Start using your tenant key

Activate the Rights Management service if it's not yet activated, to enable your organization to start using Azure Information Protection. Users immediately start to use your tenant key.

For more information, see [Activate the Azure Rights Management service](./activate-service.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If you decided to manage your own tenant key after the Rights Management service was activated, users are gradually transitioned from the old key to the new key over the course of a few weeks.
>
>During this transition, documents and files that were protected with the old tenant key remain accessible to authorized users.

## Consider usage logging

Usage logging logs every transaction that the Azure Rights Management service performs.

Depending on your key management method, logging information may include details about your tenant key. The following image shows an example from a log file displayed in Excel, where the **KeyVaultDecryptRequest** and **KeyVaultSignRequest** request types show that the tenant key is being used.

For more information about usage logging, see [Logging and analyzing the protection usage from Azure Information Protection](./log-analyze-usage.md).
