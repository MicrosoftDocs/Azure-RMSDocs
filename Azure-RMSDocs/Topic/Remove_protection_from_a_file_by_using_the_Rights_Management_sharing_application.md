# Remove protection from a file by using the Rights Management sharing application
To remove protection from a file (that is, unprotect a file) that was previously protected by using the RMS sharing application, use the **Remove Protection** option from File Explorer.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must be an owner of the file to remove protection.

### To remove protection from a file

1.  From File Explorer, right-click the file (for example, Sample.ptxt), select **Protect with RMS**, click **Protect in-place**, and then click **Remove Protection**:

    You might be prompted for credentials.

The original protected file is deleted (for example, Sample.ptxt) and replaced with a file that has the same name but with the unprotected file name extension (for example, Sample.txt).

## Examples and other instructions
For examples for how you might use the Rights Management sharing application, and how-to instructions, see the following sections from the Rights Management sharing application user guide:
