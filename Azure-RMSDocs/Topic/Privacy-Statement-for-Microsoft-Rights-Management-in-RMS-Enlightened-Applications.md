# Privacy Statement for Microsoft Rights Management in RMS-Enlightened Applications
Applies To: Microsoft Rights Management functionality which is embedded in applications

> [!NOTE]
> This privacy statement is available in additional languages from the [Microsoft Download Center](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=41668).

Microsoft is committed to protecting your privacy, while delivering software that brings you the performance, power, and convenience you desire in your personal computing. This privacy statement explains many of the data collection and use practices of the Microsoft Rights Management client software or service and any other Microsoft products or services that display or link to this notice.

The Rights Management functionality is designed for client machines and mobile devices to help protect access to and usage of information flowing through enabled applications that use Microsoft Rights Management services, whether installed on premises or running in a Microsoft datacenter.

## Processing Your Information On Behalf of Our Customer
In order to access protected files, you will be asked to log in to Microsoft Rights Management and provide your user name and password (“Credentials”). Microsoft may collect Read Receipt Information and “Standard Device Information” which includes information such as your operating system version and hardware ID, which indicates the device manufacturer, device name, and version, and IP address.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We may disclose “Read Receipt Information” (such as email address, location, and timestamp associated with opening a file) and Standard Device Information to the person or company that protected the files.

## Microsoft’s Collection and Use of Your Information
The Credentials and Standard Device Information we collect from you may also be used by Microsoft and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates to enable the features you are using and provide additional service(s) or carry out the transaction(s) you have requested or authorized. Standard Device Information may also be used to analyze and improve Microsoft products and services.

We will not disclose the Credentials, Read Receipt, and/or Standard Device Information we collect from you outside of Microsoft or its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates except as you direct, or as described in your agreement(s) or this privacy statement.

We occasionally contract with other companies to provide services (such as customer support) on our behalf. We may provide these companies with access to your information where necessary for their engagement. These companies are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information and are prohibited from using it for any purpose other than that for which they are engaged by Microsoft.

We will not disclose Credentials, Read Receipt, and/or Standard Device Information to a third party (including law enforcement, other government entity, or civil litigant; excluding our subcontractors) except as you direct, as described in this privacy statement, or unless required by law. Should a third party contact us with a demand for such information, we will attempt to redirect the third party to request it directly from you. As part of that, we may provide your basic contact information to the third party. If compelled to disclose your information to a third party, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you in advance of a disclosure unless legally prohibited.

Information that is collected by or sent to Microsoft by Microsoft Rights Management enabled applications may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Microsoft or its affiliates, subsidiaries, or service providers maintain facilities. Microsoft abides by the safe harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union, the European Economic Area, and Switzerland.

## Microsoft Update
When you use Microsoft Rights Management enabled applications with Windows, you may choose to participate in Microsoft Update. Microsoft Update (MU) is a service that provides updates for Microsoft software, including Microsoft Rights Management client for Windows. For details about what information is collected, how it is used and how to change your settings, see the [Update Services Privacy Statement](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50142) ([http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50142](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50142)).

Choice/Control: For silent installation, Microsoft Rights Management enabled applications follow the same MU settings applied to the Windows desktop. For user installations, if MU is not turned on, you may receive a prompt during installation permitting you to turn on MU. If you choose to do so, these MU settings will apply across all Windows-based applications.

## Security of your information
Microsoft is committed to helping protect the security of your information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the information you provide on computer systems with limited access, which are located in controlled facilities.

## Changes to this privacy statement
We will occasionally update this privacy statement to reflect changes in our products, services, and customer feedback. When we post changes, we will revise the "last updated" date at the top of this statement. If there are material changes to this statement or in how Microsoft will use your personal information, we will notify you either by posting a notice of such changes prior to implementing the change or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to periodically review this statement to be informed of how Microsoft is protecting your information.
