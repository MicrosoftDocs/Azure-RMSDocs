The following sections provide additional information about [!INCLUDE[aad_rightsmanagement_1](../Token/aad_rightsmanagement_1_md.md)]:

-   [Search the documentation library](../Topic/Information_and_Support_for_Azure_Rights_Management.md#BKMK_SearchTips)

-   [Downloadable documentation](../Topic/Information_and_Support_for_Azure_Rights_Management.md#BKMK_Download)

-   [The Rights Management product group blog](../Topic/Information_and_Support_for_Azure_Rights_Management.md#BKMK_ProductGroupBlog)

-   [Support options and community resources](../Topic/Information_and_Support_for_Azure_Rights_Management.md#BKMK_SupportOptions)

## <a name="BKMK_SearchTips"></a>Search the documentation library
[Use this scoped search query](http://www.bing.com/search?q=%28"Rights%20Management"%29%20site:technet.microsoft.com/library%20meta:search.MSCategory%28jj619159%29) to find documentation in the TechNet Library that is scoped to [!INCLUDE[aad_rightsmanagement_1](../Token/aad_rightsmanagement_1_md.md)] only.

The search results for that query do not include results about Active Directory Rights Management Services (AD RMS) or Windows Rights Management, or community resources. You can narrow the search results further by replacing the string, “Rights Management,” in the URL with your own search string.

### Example searches
[Use this search query](http://www.bing.com/search?q=%28"Rights%20Management"%29%20site:technet.microsoft.com/library%20meta:search.MSCategory%28jj619159%29) and then customize the search by using the following examples.

-   Single search string: To search for topics that contain the search string **RMS connector**, replace **“Rights Management”** with **“RMS connector”**:

    ```
    ("RMS connector") site:technet.microsoft.com/library meta:search.MSCategory(jj619159)
    ```

-   Combining search strings: To search for topics that contain the search strings **Exchange** and **SharePoint**, use the **AND** operator:

    ```
    ("Exchange") AND ("SharePoint") site:technet.microsoft.com/library meta:search.MSCategory(jj619159)
    ```

-   Alternative search strings: To search for topics that contain the search string **Exchange** or **SharePoint**, use the **OR** operator:

    ```
    ("Exchange" OR "SharePoint") site:technet.microsoft.com/library meta:search.MSCategory(jj619159)
    ```

-   Exclude search strings: To search for topics that contain the search string **Exchange** and exclude topics about **SharePoint**, use the **NOT** operator:

    ```
    ("Exchange)" NOT ("SharePoint") site:technet.microsoft.com/library meta:search.MSCategory(jj619159)
    ```

### Search tips
Use the following search tips to help you find the information that you need:

-   When you are searching for official documentation, use search terms that match those that you see in the user interface (UI) and TechNet documentation, rather than unofficial terms or abbreviations that you might see in community content. For example, search for "Azure Rights Management" rather than "AADRMS" or other unofficial abbreviations for this cloud service. Although you might often hear and see “RMS”, the full name is Rights Management service, so try searching for “rights management” rather than RMS when you are looking for official documentation. You can use the [Terminology for Azure Rights Management](../Topic/Terminology_for_Azure_Rights_Management.md) to help identify official terms that are specific to [!INCLUDE[aad_rightsmanagement_1](../Token/aad_rightsmanagement_1_md.md)].

-   When you search on a page in TechNet (press Ctrl-F, and enter search terms in the **Find** box), the results exclude text that is in collapsed sections. To search for text in collapsed sections, expand the sections before you search the page. To do this, you can click the **Expand All** button at the top of the page, or double-click any collapsed section. When all sections are expanded, a search of the page will then search all sections on that page.

-   Whenever possible, use the TechNet library online rather than downloaded documentation. TechNet Library online contains the most up-to-date information, and the information that you are searching for might not be in the downloaded documentation or there might be corrections or additional information online.

-   If you find it easier and faster to search documentation when it is stored locally, you can select multiple topics on TechNet and save them locally. For more information, see the next section.

## <a name="BKMK_Download"></a>Downloadable documentation
You can download pages from TechNet and save them locally —for example, save them to a PDF file to read on your laptop, tablet, or phone when you don’t have Internet connectivity. Or, annotate them yourself and print the information. Using this method, you can effectively create your own white papers or project documentation by grouping together the topics that you need for a specific set of tasks, or for an end-to-end scenario.

This method works for all documentation libraries on TechNet, not just [!INCLUDE[aad_rightsmanagement_1](../Token/aad_rightsmanagement_1_md.md)].

#### To download the docs from TechNet:

1.  Sign in to TechNet.

2.  On the top of the page that you want to save locally, click **Export** (next to **Print**).

    You then see the **Export multiple sets of pages** banner that lets you add and remove pages that you want to save.

3.  Click **Manage pages** to export them.

For more information, click **Help** on the banner.

> [!NOTE]
> Information on TechNet is frequently updated, so use the online version whenever possible to ensure that you have the latest information.
> 
> You can use the monthly documentation announcements on the [Microsoft Rights Management (RMS) Team Blog and the docs tag](http://blogs.technet.com/b/rms/archive/tags/docs/) to check whether topics that you have previously downloaded for [!INCLUDE[aad_rightsmanagement_1](../Token/aad_rightsmanagement_1_md.md)] are now revised, and what changes were made.

## <a name="BKMK_ProductGroupBlog"></a>The Rights Management product group blog
The Rights Management product group uses the [Microsoft Rights Management (RMS) Team Blog](http://blogs.technet.com/b/rms/) to provide you with technical information and other news about [!INCLUDE[aad_rightsmanagement_1](../Token/aad_rightsmanagement_1_md.md)], AD RMS, and related technologies. These blog posts supplement the product documentation and support information.

> [!TIP]
> If you are developing applications for Azure RMS or AD RMS, you might also be interested in the [Active Directory Rights Management Services (AD RMS) Developer's Corner Blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/rms/).
