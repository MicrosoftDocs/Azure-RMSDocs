# Revised Version 2: Rights Management sharing application user guide - working version, sandbox only
The Microsoft Rights Management (RMS) sharing application for Windows helps you keep important documents and pictures safe from people who shouldn’t see them, even if you email them or save them to another device. You can also use this application to open and use files that other people have protected by using the same Rights Management technology.

All you need is a computer that runs at least Windows 7, and a local administrator account to install the RMS sharing application. Then download and install this free application from Microsoft.

If you have questions that are not answered by this guide, see [FAQ for Microsoft Rights Management Sharing Application for Windows](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=303971).

## <a name="BKMK_SharingExamples"></a>Here are just some examples of how you might use the RMS sharing application, to help protect your files.

|I want to ….|How to do this|
|----------------|------------------|
|**… safely share financial information with somebody I trust who is outside my organization**<br /><br />You work with a partner company and want to email them an Excel spreadsheet that contains projected sales figures. You want them to be able to view the figures but not change them.|You use the **Share Protected** button on the ribbon in Excel, type the email addresses of the two people that you work with in the partner company, select **Viewer** on the slider, and click **Send**.<br /><br />When the email arrives at the partner company, only the recipients in the email can view the spreadsheet and they cannot save, edit, print, or forward it.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Step-by-step: [Protect a file that you share by email by using the Rights Management sharing application](../Topic/Protect_a_file_that_you_share_by_email_by_using_the_Rights_Management_sharing_application.md).|
|**… safely send a document by email to somebody who uses an iOS device**<br /><br />You want to email a highly confidential Word document to a coworker, who you know, regularly checks email on their iOS device.|You use File Explorer to right-click the file, and select Share Protected. In the RMS sharing application, you select the **Allow consumption on all devices** option, and send the file as an attachment to your coworker.<br /><br />The recipient receives the email on their iOS device, clicks the link in the email that tells them how to download the sharing application, installs the version for iOS devices, and then views the document.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Step-by-step: [Protect a file that you share by email by using the Rights Management sharing application](../Topic/Protect_a_file_that_you_share_by_email_by_using_the_Rights_Management_sharing_application.md).|
|**… read an attachment I’ve received in an email message that has a securely shared file attachment but I can’t read it because my company doesn’t use Rights Management**<br /><br />The email sender is somebody who you trust because you’ve done business with them in the past and you suspect that they might be sending you information about a potential new business opportunity.|You follow the instructions in the email and click the link to sign up for Microsoft Rights Management. Microsoft confirms that your organization does not have a subscription to Office 365, sends you an email to complete the free signup process, and you sign in with your new account. You click the second link in the email to install the Rights Management sharing app and can then open the email attachment to read about the new business opportunity.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Step-by-step: [View and use files that have been protected by Rights Management](../Topic/View_and_use_files_that_have_been_protected_by_Rights_Management.md).|
|**… protect company-confidential files on my laptop so they can’t be accessed by people outside my company**<br /><br />You travel a lot and use your laptop to access and update files in a folder that must be secured against unauthorized access.|You have the RMS sharing application installed on your laptop. You use File Explorer to protect the files by using a template, which quickly protects the files. If your laptop is stolen, you have peace of mind that nobody outside your company can access these documents.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Step-by-step: [Protect a file on a device &#40;protect in-place&#41; by using the Rights Management sharing application](../Topic/Protect_a_file_on_a_device__protect_in-place__by_using_the_Rights_Management_sharing_application.md).|
