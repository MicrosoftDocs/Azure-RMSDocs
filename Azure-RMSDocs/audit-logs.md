## Deprecation notice

Azure Information Protection analytics will be deprecated on September 30, 2022.

Starting March 1, 2022, new customers are no longer onboarded to Azure Information Protection analytics.

Instead, we highly recommend that you use the Microsoft 365 compliance center's [activity explorer](/microsoft-365/compliance/data-classification-activity-explorer) and [content explorer](/microsoft-365/compliance/data-classification-content-explorer), which provide comprehensive logging and reporting.

For more information, see our [TechCommunity blog post](placeholder).

## Next steps

AIP audit logs are also sent to the Microsoft 365 Activity Explorer, where they may be displayed with different names.

For more information, see:

- [Get started with activity explorer](/microsoft-365/compliance/data-classification-activity-explorer)
- [Labeling activity reference in activity explorer](/microsoft-365/compliance/data-classification-activity-explorer-available-events), including mapping between names displayed in AIP and in the Microsoft 365 activity explorer
- [Central reporting for Azure Information Protection (public preview)](reports-aip.md)

To prevent the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client from sending auditing data, configure a [label policy advanced setting](rms-client/clientv2-admin-guide-customizations.md#prevent-audit-data-from-being-sent-to-aip-and-microsoft-365-analytics).
