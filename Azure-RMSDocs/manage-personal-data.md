# Manage personal data for Azure Information Protection

>***Applies to**: [Azure Information Protection](/office365/servicedescriptions/microsoft-365-service-descriptions/microsoft-365-tenantlevel-services-licensing-guidance/microsoft-365-security-compliance-licensing-guidance#information-protection)*
>
>***Relevant for**: [AIP unified labeling client and classic client](faqs.md#whats-the-difference-between-the-azure-information-protection-classic-and-unified-labeling-clients)*

[!INCLUDE [AIP classic client is sunset](includes/classic-client-sunset.md)]

When you configure and use Azure Information Protection, email addresses and IP addresses are stored and used by the Azure Information Protection service. This personal data can be found in the following items:

- Super users and delegated administrators for the protection service 

- Administration logs for the protection service

- Usage logs for the protection service

- Usage logs for the Azure Information Protection clients and RMS client 

**AIP classic client only**:

- The Azure Information Protection policy

- Templates for the protection service

- Document tracking logs

[!INCLUDE [GDPR-related guidance](./includes/gdpr-intro-sentence.md)]

## Viewing personal data that Azure Information Protection uses

- **Unified labeling client**:

    For the unified labeling client, sensitivity labels and label policies are configured in the Microsoft 365 compliance center. For more information, see the [Microsoft 365 documentation](/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels).

- **Classic client**:

    For the classic client, use the Azure portal to specify email addresses for scoped policies and for protection settings within a label configuration. For more information, see [How to configure the Azure Information Protection policy for specific users by using scoped policies](configure-policy-scope.md) and [How to configure a label for Rights Management protection](configure-policy-protection.md). 

    For labels that are configured to apply protection from the Azure Rights Management service, email address can also be found in protection templates, by using PowerShell cmdlets from the [AIPService module](/powershell/module/aipservice). This PowerShell module also lets an administrator specify users by email address to be a [super user](configure-super-users.md), or an administrator for the Azure Rights Management service. 

> [!NOTE]
> When Azure Information Protection is used to classify and protect documents and emails, email addresses and the users' IP addresses might be saved in log files.
> 

### Super users and delegated administrators for the protection service

Run the [Get-AipServiceSuperUser](/powershell/module/aipservice/get-aipservicesuperuser) cmdlet and [get-aipservicerolebasedadministrator](/powershell/module/aipservice/get-aipservicerolebasedadministrator) cmdlet to see which users have been assigned the super user role or global administrator role for the protection service (Azure Rights Management) from Azure Information Protection. For users who have been assigned either of these roles, their email addresses are displayed.


### Administration logs for the protection service

Run the [Get-AipServiceAdminLog](/powershell/module/aipservice/get-aipserviceadminlog) cmdlet to get a log of admin actions for the protection service (Azure Rights Management) from Azure Information Protection. This log includes personal data in the form of email addresses and IP addresses. The log is in plaintext and after it is downloaded, the details of a specific administrator can be searched offline.

For example:
```PowerShell
PS C:\Users> Get-AipServiceAdminLog -Path '.\Desktop\admin.log' -FromTime 4/1/2018 -ToTime 4/30/2018 -Verbose
The Rights Management administration log was successfully generated and can be found at .\Desktop\admin.log.
```

### Usage logs for the protection service
Run the [Get-AipServiceUserLog](/powershell/module/aipservice/get-aipserviceuserlog) cmdlet to retrieve a log of end-user actions that use the protection service from Azure Information Protection. The log could include personal data in the form of email addresses and IP addresses. The log is in plaintext and after it is downloaded, the details of a specific administrator can be searched offline.

For example:
```PowerShell
PS C:\Users> Get-AipServiceUserLog -Path '.\Desktop\' -FromDate 4/1/2018 -ToDate 4/30/2018 -NumberOfThreads 10

### Usage logs for the Azure Information Protection clients and RMS client

When labels and protection are applied to documents and emails, email addresses and IP addresses can be stored in log files on a user's computer in the following locations:

- For the Azure Information Protection unified labeling and classic clients: **%localappdata%\Microsoft\MSIP\Logs**

- For the RMS client: **%localappdata%\Microsoft\MSIPC\msip\Logs**

In addition, the Azure Information Protection client logs this personal data to the local Windows event log **Applications and Services Logs** > **Azure Information Protection**.

When the Azure Information Protection client runs the scanner, personal data is saved to **%localappdata%\Microsoft\MSIP\Scanner\Reports** on the Windows Server computer that runs the scanner.

You can turn off logging information for the Azure Information Protection client and the scanner by using the following configurations:

- For the Azure Information Protection client: Create an [advanced client setting](./rms-client/clientv2-admin-guide-customizations.md#change-the-local-logging-level) that configures the **LogLevel** to **Off**.

- For the Azure Information Protection scanner: Use the [Set-AIPScannerConfiguration](/powershell/module/azureinformationprotection/set-aipscannerconfiguration) cmdlet to set the *ReportLevel* parameter to **Off**.

[!INCLUDE [GDPR-related guidance](./includes/gdpr-hybrid-note.md)]

### Protection templates

**Relevant for**: AIP classic client only

Run the [Get-AipServiceTemplate](/powershell/module/aipservice/get-aipservicetemplate) cmdlet to get a list of protection templates. You can use the template ID to get details of a specific template. The `RightsDefinitions` object displays the personal data, if any. 

Example:
```PowerShell
PS C:\Users> Get-AipServiceTemplate -TemplateId fcdbbc36-1f48-48ca-887f-265ee1268f51 | select *


TemplateId              : fcdbbc36-1f48-48ca-887f-265ee1268f51

### Document tracking logs

**Relevant for**: AIP classic client only

Run the [Get-AipServiceDocumentLog](/powershell/module/aipservice/get-aipservicedocumentlog) cmdlet to retrieve information from the document tracking site about a specific user. To get tracking information associated with the document logs, use the [Get-AipServiceTrackingLog](/powershell/module/aipservice/get-aipservicetrackinglog) cmdlet.

For example:
```PowerShell
PS C:\Users> Get-AipServiceDocumentLog -UserEmail "admin@aip500.onmicrosoft.com"

There is no search by ObjectID. However, you are not restricted by the `-UserEmail` parameter and the email address you provide doesn't need to be part of your tenant. If the email address provided is stored anywhere in the document tracking logs, the document tracking entry is returned in the cmdlet output.

## Securing and controlling access to personal information

Personal data that you view and specify in the Azure portal is accessible only to users who have been assigned one of the following [administrator roles from Azure Active Directory](/azure/active-directory/active-directory-assign-admin-roles-azure-portal):
    
- **Azure Information Protection administrator**

- **Compliance administrator**

- **Compliance data administrator**

- **Security administrator**

- **Security reader**

- **Global administrator**

- **Global reader**

Personal data that you view and specify by using the AIPService module (or the older module, AADRM) is accessible only to users who have been assigned the **Azure Information Protection administrator**, **Compliance administrator**, **Compliance data administrator**, or **Global Administrator** roles from Azure Active Directory, or the global administrator role for the protection service.

## Updating personal data

**Unified labeling client**:

For the unified labeling client, sensitivity labels and label policies are configured in the Microsoft 365 compliance center. For more information, see the [Microsoft 365 documentation](/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels).

**Classic client**:

For the classic client, you can update email addresses for scoped policies and protection settings in the Azure Information Protection policy. For more information, see [How to configure the Azure Information Protection policy for specific users by using scoped policies](configure-policy-scope.md) and [How to configure a label for Rights Management protection](configure-policy-protection.md). 

For the protection settings, you can update the same information by using PowerShell cmdlets from the [AIPService module](/powershell/module/aipservice).

You cannot update email addresses for the super users and delegated administrators. Instead, remove the specified user account, and add the user account with the updated email address. 

### Super users and delegated administrators for the protection service

When you need update an email address for a super user:

1. Use [Remove-AipServiceSuperUser](/powershell/module/aipservice/Remove-AipServiceSuperUser) to remove the user and old email address.

2. Use [Add-AipServiceSuperUser](/powershell/module/aipservice/Add-AipServiceSuperUser) to add the user and new email address.

When you need update an email address for a delegated administrator:

1. Use [Remove-AipServiceRoleBasedAdministrator](/powershell/module/aipservice/Remove-AipServiceRoleBasedAdministrator) to remove the user and old email address.

2. Use [Add-AipServiceRoleBasedAdministrator](/powershell/module/aipservice/Add-AipServiceRoleBasedAdministrator) to add the user and new email address.

### Protection templates

**Relevant for**: Classic client only

Run the [Set-AipServiceTemplateProperty](/powershell/module/aipservice/set-aipservicetemplateproperty) cmdlet to update the protection template. Because the personal data is within the `RightsDefinitions` property, you will also need to use the [New-AipServiceRightsDefinition](/powershell/module/aipservice/new-aipservicerightsdefinition) cmdlet to create a rights definitions object with the updated information, and use the rights definitions object with the `Set-AipServiceTemplateProperty` cmdlet.

## Deleting personal data

- **Unified labeling client**:

    For the unified labeling client, sensitivity labels and label policies are configured in the Microsoft 365 compliance center. For more information, see the [Microsoft 365 documentation](/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels).

- **Classic client**:

    For the classic client, you can delete email addresses for scoped policies and protection settings in the Azure Information Protection policy. For more information, see [How to configure the Azure Information Protection policy for specific users by using scoped policies](configure-policy-scope.md) and [How to configure a label for Rights Management protection](configure-policy-protection.md). 

For the protection settings, you can delete the same information by using PowerShell cmdlets from the [AIPService module](/powershell/module/aipservice).

To delete email addresses for super users and delegated administrators, remove these users by using the [Remove-AipServiceSuperUser](/powershell/module/aipservice/Remove-AipServiceSuperUser) cmdlet and [Remove-AipServiceRoleBasedAdministrator](/powershell/module/aipservice/Remove-AipServiceRoleBasedAdministrator). 

To delete personal data in document tracking logs, administration logs, or usage logs for the protection service, use the following section to raise a request with Microsoft Support.

To delete personal data in the client log files and scanner logs that are stored  on computers, use any standard Windows tools to delete the files or personal data within the files. 

### To delete personal data with Microsoft Support

Use the following three steps to request that Microsoft deletes personal data in document tracking logs, administration logs, or usage logs for the protection service. 

**Step 1: Initiate delete request**
[Contact Microsoft Support](information-support.md#to-contact-microsoft-support) to open an Azure Information Protection support case with a request for deleting data from your tenant. You must prove that you are an administrator for your Azure Information Protection tenant and understand that this process takes several days to confirm. While submitting your request, you will need to provide additional information, depending on the data that needs to be deleted.

- To delete the administration log, provide the **end date**. All admin logs until that end date will be deleted.
- To delete the usage logs, provide the **end date**. All usage logs until that end date will be deleted.
- To delete the document tracking logs, provide the **end date** and **UserEmail**. All document tracking information relating to the UserEmail until that end date will be deleted. Regular expression (Perl format) for UserEmail is supported.

Deleting this data is a permanent action. There is no means to recover the data after a delete request has been processed. It is recommended that administrators export the required data before submitting a delete request.

**Step 2: Wait for verification**
Microsoft will verify that your request to delete one or more logs is legitimate. This process can take up to five working days.

**Step 3: Get confirmation of the deletion**
Microsoft Customer Support Services (CSS) will send you a confirmation email that the data has been deleted. 

## Exporting personal data
When you use the AIPService or AADRM PowerShell cmdlets, the personal data is made available for search and export as a PowerShell object. The PowerShell object can be converted into JSON and saved by using the `ConvertTo-Json` cmdlet.

## Restricting the use of personal data for profiling or marketing without consent
Azure Information Protection follows Microsoft's [privacy terms](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement) for profiling or marketing based on personal data.

## Auditing and reporting
Only users who have been assigned [administrator permissions](#securing-and-controlling-access-to-personal-information) can use the AIPService or ADDRM module for search and export of personal data. These operations are recorded in the administration  log that can be downloaded.

For delete actions, the support request acts as the auditing and reporting trail for the actions performed by Microsoft. After deletion, the deleted data will not be available for search and export, and the administrator can verify this using the Get cmdlets from the AIPService module.
