# Quick start tutorial for Azure Information Protection 

>*Applies to: [Azure Information Protection](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/information-protection)*

Use this tutorial to quickly try out Azure Information Protection with just 5 steps that should take you about 20 minutes. This tutorial is designed to be a self-guided demo to quickly show case some of the features and functionality that Azure Information Protection offers. It does not include all the available features and is not intended to be a deployment guide for your organization. If you are looking to deploy Azure Information Protection for your organization, see the [deployment roadmap documentation](deployment-roadmap.md). 

This tutorial is intended for IT administrators and consultants, to help them evaluate Azure Information Protection as an enterprise information protection solution for an organization. In a production environment, the steps to configure the Information Protection policy, and install the client for users would be done by an administrator. The steps to label the document and safely share a document by email and track it would be done by end users. This tutorial includes all these steps, to demonstrate typical end-to-end scenarios of classifying, labeling, and protecting your organization's data. 

If you have any problems completing this tutorial, using Azure Information Protection, or want to see what others are saying about it, head over to the [Azure Information Protection Yammer site](https://www.yammer.com/askipteam/#/threads/inGroup?type=in_group&feedId=8652489&view=all).

## Prerequisites 
To complete this tutorial, you need the following:

- A subscription that includes Azure Information Protection for classification, labeling, and protection. This tutorial includes some of the advanced features, such as automated data classification with user recommendations, and the document tracking site. Make sure that you have a subscription to support these features for this tutorial. For more information, see the feature list from the [Azure Information Protection pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/information-protection) page.
    
    If you don't have a subscription for these features, you can sign up for a free trial for [Enterprise Mobility + Security E5](https://portal.office.com/Signup/Signup.aspx?OfferId=87dd2714-d452-48a0-a809-d2f58c4f68b7).
    
  > [!TIP] 
  > If you need to apply for a subscription, do this in advance because this process can sometimes take a while to complete.

- A global administrator account to sign in to the Azure portal to activate protection and configure the Azure Information Protection policy. Alternatively, you can use an account that has either of the following administrative roles: [Information Protection Administrator or Security Administrator](/azure/active-directory/active-directory-assign-admin-roles-azure-portal). This account must also have an email address and a working email service, such as Exchange Online.

- A computer running Windows (minimum of Windows 7 with Service Pack 1), and which has installed either Office 365 ProPlus with 2016 apps or 2013 apps, Office Professional Plus 2016, Office Professional Plus 2013 with Service Pack 1, or Office Professional Plus 2010 with Service Pack 2. 
    
    To use these applications with Azure Information Protection, you must have an [Office 365 subscription that includes using the Azure Rights Management service](http://download.microsoft.com/download/E/C/F/ECF42E71-4EC0-48FF-AA00-577AC14D5B5C/Azure_Information_Protection_licensing_datasheet_EN-US.pdf). For example, an Office 365 E3 or Office 365 E5 subscription. Using a license from this subscription, you must be signed in to your Office apps.

Let's get started.
