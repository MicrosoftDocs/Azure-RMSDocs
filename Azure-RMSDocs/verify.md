# Verifying the Azure Rights Management service


When the protection service (Azure Rights Management) from Azure Information Protection is activated and you have performed any additional configuration steps that are required for your organization, you are ready to verify that this protection service is working as expected. 

A simple verification test is to protect a document or email message by using one user account, and then attempt to open and use that protected content from another user account on a different computer.

For instructions to complete this testing, see the information in [Helping users to protect files by using the Azure Rights Management service](help-users.md).

If your testing is unsuccessful, review the configuration steps in [AIP deployment roadmap for classification, labeling, and protection](deployment-roadmap-classify-label-protect.md).

> [!TIP]
> If you need additional help, see the [Support options and community resources](information-support.md#support-options-and-community-resources) section in the [Information and support for Azure Information Protection](information-support.md) article.

## Next steps

You can monitor how your organization is using this protection service by using usage logging. For more information, see [Logging and analyzing the protection usage from Azure Information Protection](log-analyze-usage.md).
