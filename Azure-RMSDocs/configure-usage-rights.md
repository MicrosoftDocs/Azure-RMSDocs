This article describes usage rights you can configure to be automatically applied when a label or template is selected by users, administrators, or configured services.

Usage rights are selected when you configure sensitivity labels or protection templates for encryption. For example, you can select roles that configure a logical grouping of usage rights, or configure the individual rights separately. Alternatively users might select and apply the usage rights themselves.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use this article to understand how usage rights are *designed* to be interpreted by applications. 
>
> Applications may vary in how they implement usage rights, and we recommend consulting with your application's documentation and performing your own testing to check application behavior before deploying in production.

## Usage rights and descriptions

The following table lists and describes the usage rights that Rights Management supports, and how they are used and interpreted. They are listed by their **common name**, which is typically how you might see the usage right displayed or referenced, as a more friendly version of the single-word value that is used in the code (the **Encoding in policy** value). 

In this table:

- The **API Constant or Value** is the SDK name for an MSIPC API call, used when you write an application that checks for a usage right, or adds a usage right to a policy.

- The **labeling admin center** is the Microsoft 365 compliance center, where you configure sensitivity labels.

    If you have the classic client, configure your labels and label policies in the Azure portal.


|Usage right|Description|Implementation|
|-------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------|
|Common name: **Edit Content, Edit** <br /><br />Encoding in policy: **DOCEDIT**|Allows the user to modify, rearrange, format, or sort the content inside the application. It does not grant the right to save the edited copy.<br /><br />In Word, unless you have Office 365 ProPlus with a minimum version of [1807](/officeupdates/monthly-channel-2018#version-1807-july-25), this right isn't  sufficient to turn on or turn off **Track Changes**, or to use all the track changes features as a reviewer. Instead, to use all the track changes options requires the following right: **Full Control**. |Office custom rights: As part of the **Change** and **Full Control** options. <br /><br />Name in the Azure classic portal: **Edit Content**<br /><br />Name in the Microsoft 365 compliance center and Azure portal: **Edit Content, Edit (DOCEDIT)**<br /><br />Name in AD RMS templates: **Edit** <br /><br />API constant or value: Not applicable.|
|Common name: **Save** <br /><br />Encoding in policy: **EDIT**|Allows the user to save the document to the current location.<br /><br />In Office applications, this right allows the user to save the file to a new location and with a new name if the selected file format has built-in support for Rights Management protection.

## Rights included in permissions levels

Some applications group usage rights together into permissions levels, to make it easier to select usage rights that are typically used together. These permissions levels help to abstract a level of complexity from users, so they can choose options that are role-based.  For example, **Reviewer** and **Co-Author**. Although these options often show users a summary of the rights, they might not include every right that is listed in the previous table.

Use the following table for a list of these permissions levels and a complete list of the usage rights that they contain. The usage rights are listed by their [common name](#usage-rights-and-descriptions).

|Permissions level|Applications|Usage rights included|
|---------------------|----------------|---------------------------------|
|**Viewer**|Azure classic portal <br /><br />Azure portal<br /><br />Azure Information Protection client for Windows|View, Open, Read; View Rights; Reply [[1]](#footnote-1); Reply All [[1]](#footnote-1); Allow Macros [[2]](#footnote-2)<br /><br />Note: For emails, use Reviewer rather than this permission level to ensure that an email reply is received as an email message rather than an attachment. Reviewer is also required when you send an email to another organization that uses the Outlook client or Outlook web app. Or, for users in your organization that are exempt from using the Azure Rights Management service because you have implemented [onboarding controls](/powershell/module/aipservice/set-aipserviceonboardingcontrolpolicy).|

## Do Not Forward option for emails

Exchange clients and services (for example, the Outlook client, Outlook on the web, Exchange mail flow rules, and DLP actions for Exchange) have an additional information rights protection option for emails: **Do Not Forward**. 

Although this option appears to users (and Exchange administrators) as if it's a default Rights Management template that they can select, **Do Not Forward** is not a template. That explains why you cannot see it in the Azure portal when you view and manage protection templates. Instead, the **Do Not Forward** option is a set of usage rights that is dynamically applied by users to their email recipients.

When the **Do Not Forward** option is applied to an email, the email is encrypted and recipients must be authenticated. Then, the recipients cannot forward it, print it, or copy from it. For example, in the Outlook client, the Forward button is not available, the **Save As** and **Print** menu options are not available, and you cannot add or change recipients in the **To**, **Cc**, or **Bcc** boxes.

Unprotected [Office documents](https://support.office.com/article/bb643d33-4a3f-4ac7-9770-fd50d95f58dc#FileTypesforIRM) that are attached to the email automatically inherit the same restrictions. The usage rights applied to these documents are **Edit Content, Edit**; **Save**; **View, Open, Read**; and **Allow Macros**. If you want different usage rights for an attachment, or your attachment is not an Office document that supports this inherited protection, protect the file before you attach it to the email. You can then assign the specific usage rights that you need for the file. 

### Difference between Do Not Forward and not granting the Forward usage right

There's an important distinction between applying the **Do Not Forward** option and applying a template that doesn't grant the **Forward** usage right to an email: The **Do Not Forward** option uses a dynamic list of authorized users that is based on the user's chosen recipients of the original email; whereas the rights in the template have a static list of authorized users that the administrator has previously specified. What's the difference? Let's take an example: 

A user wants to email some information to specific people in the Marketing department that shouldn't be shared with anybody else. Should she protect the email with a template that restricts rights (viewing, replying, and saving) to the Marketing department?  Or should she choose the **Do Not Forward** option? Both choices would result in the recipients not able to forward the email. 

- If she applied the template, the recipients could still share the information with others in the marketing department. For example, a recipient could use Explorer to drag and drop the email to a shared location or a USB drive. Now, anybody from the marketing department (and the email owner) who has access to this location can view the information in the email.
 
- If she applied the **Do Not Forward** option, the recipients will not be able to share the information with anybody else in the marketing department by moving the email to another location. In this scenario, only the original recipients (and the email owner) will be able to view the information in the email.

> [!NOTE] 
> Use **Do Not Forward** when it's important that only the recipients that the sender chooses should see the information in the email. Use a template for emails to restrict rights to a group of people that the administrator specifies in advance, independently from the sender's chosen recipients.

## Encrypt-only option for emails

When Exchange Online uses the new capabilities for Office 365 Message Encryption, a new **Encrypt** email option becomes available, to encrypt the data without additional restrictions.

This option is available to tenants who use Exchange Online and can be selected as follows:

- **In Outlook on the web** with the **Encrypt** option or a sensitivity label that's configured for **Let users assign permissions** and the **Encrypt-Only** option
- **As another rights protection option** for a mail flow rule
- **As an Office 365 DLP action**
- **From the Outlook app** for desktops and mobile devices:
    - With a sensitivity label that's configured for **Let users assign permissions** and the **Encrypt-Only** option, for Windows, macOS, iOS and Android when you use built-in labeling with the minimum versions listed in the [table for sensitivity label capabilities in Outlook](/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels-office-apps#sensitivity-label-capabilities-in-outlook).
    - With the **Encrypt** option on Windows and macOS, for the versions listed in the [table of supported versions for Microsoft 365 Apps by update channel](/officeupdates/update-history-microsoft365-apps-by-date), when you have [Microsoft 365 apps that support Azure Rights Management](requirements-applications.md).

For more information about the encrypt-only option, see the following blog post when it was first announced from the Office team: [Encrypt only rolling out in Office 365 Message Encryption](https://aka.ms/omefeb2018).

When this option is selected, the email is encrypted and recipients must be authenticated. Then, the recipients have all usage rights except **Save As, Export** and **Full Control**. This combination of usage rights means that the recipients have no restrictions except that they cannot remove the protection. For example, a recipient can copy from the email, print it, and forward it.

Similarly, by default, unprotected [Office documents](https://support.office.com/article/bb643d33-4a3f-4ac7-9770-fd50d95f58dc#FileTypesforIRM) that are attached to the email inherit the same permissions. These documents are automatically protected and when they are downloaded, they can be saved, edited, copied, and printed from Office applications by the recipients. When the document is saved by a recipient, it can be saved to a new name and even a different format. However, only file formats that support protection are available so that the document cannot be saved without the original protection. If you want different usage rights for an attachment, or your attachment is not an Office document that supports this inherited protection, protect the file before you attach it to the email. You can then assign the specific usage rights that you need for the file.

Alternatively, you can change this protection inheritance of documents by specifying `Set-IRMConfiguration -DecryptAttachmentForEncryptOnly $true` with [Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/exchange-online/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell). Use this configuration when you don't need to retain the original protection for the document after the user is authenticated. When recipients open the email message, the document is not protected.

If you do need an attached document to retain the original protection, see [Secure document collaboration by using Azure Information Protection](secure-collaboration-documents.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If you see references to **DecryptAttachmentFromPortal**, this parameter is now deprecated for [Set-IRMConfiguration](/powershell/module/exchange/encryption-and-certificates/set-irmconfiguration). Unless you have previously set this parameter, it is not available.
> 
## Automatically encrypt PDF documents with Exchange Online

When Exchange Online uses the new capabilities for Office 365 Message Encryption, you can automatically encrypt unprotected PDF documents when they are attached to an encrypted email. The document inherits the same permissions as those for the email message. To enable this configuration, set **EnablePdfEncryption $True** with [Set-IRMConfiguration](/powershell/module/exchange/encryption-and-certificates/set-irmconfiguration).

Recipients who don't already have a reader installed that supports the ISO standard for PDF encryption can install one of the readers listed in [PDF readers that support Microsoft Information Protection](./rms-client/protected-pdf-readers.md). Alternatively, recipients can read the protected PDF document in the OME portal.

## Rights Management issuer and Rights Management owner

When a document or email is protected by using the Azure Rights Management service, the account that protects that content automatically becomes the Rights Management issuer for that content. This account is logged as the **issuer** field in the [usage logs](log-analyze-usage.md#how-to-interpret-your-usage-logs). 

The Rights Management issuer is always granted the Full Control usage right for the document or email, and in addition:

- If the protection settings include an expiry date, the Rights Management issuer can still open and edit the document or email after that date.

- The Rights Management issuer can always access the document or email offline.

- The Rights Management issuer can still open a document after it is revoked. 

By default, this account is also the **Rights Management owner** for that content, which is the case when a user who created the document or email initiates the protection. But there are some scenarios where an administrator or service can protect content on behalf of users. For example:

- An administrator bulk-protects files on a file share: The administrator account in Azure AD protects the documents for the users.

- The Rights Management connector protects Office documents on a Windows Server folder: The service principal account in Azure AD that is created for the RMS connector protects the documents for the users.

In these scenarios, the Rights Management issuer can assign the Rights Management owner to another account by using the Azure Information Protection SDKs or PowerShell. For example, when you use the [Protect-RMSFile](/powershell/module/azureinformationprotection/protect-rmsfile) PowerShell cmdlet with the Azure Information Protection client, you can specify the **OwnerEmail** parameter to assign the Rights Management owner to another account. 

When the Rights Management issuer protects on behalf of users, assigning the Rights Management owner ensures that the original document or email owner has the same level of control for their protected content as if they initiated the protection themselves. 

For example, the user who created the document can print it, even though it's now protected with a template that doesn't include the Print usage right. The same user can always access their document, regardless of the offline access setting or expiry date that might have been configured in that template. In addition, because the Rights Management owner has the Full Control usage right, this user can also reprotect the document to grant additional users access (at which point the user then becomes the Rights Management issuer as well as the Rights Management owner), and this user can even remove the protection. However, only the Rights Management issuer can track and revoke a document.

The Rights Management owner for a document or email is logged as the **owner-email** field in the [usage logs](log-analyze-usage.md#how-to-interpret-your-usage-logs).

> [!NOTE]
> The Rights Management owner is independent from the Windows file system Owner. They are often the same but can be different, even if you don't use the SDKs or PowerShell.
> 
## Rights Management use license

When a user opens a document or email that has been protected by Azure Rights Management, a Rights Management use license for that content is granted to the user. This use license is a certificate that contains the user's usage rights for the document or email message, and the encryption key that was used to encrypt the content. The use license also contains an expiry date if this has been set, and how long the use license is valid.

A user must have a valid use license to open the content in addition to their rights account certificate (RAC), which is a certificate that's granted when the [user environment is initialized](how-does-it-work.md#initializing-the-user-environment) and then renewed every 31 days.

For the duration of the use license, the user is not reauthenticated or reauthorized for the content. This lets the user continue to open the protected document or email without an internet connection. When the use license validity period expires, the next time the user accesses the protected document or email, the user must be reauthenticated and reauthorized. 

When documents and email messages are protected by using a label or a template that defines the protection settings, you can change these settings in your label or template without having to reprotect the content. If the user has already accessed the content, the changes take effect after their use license has expired. However, when users apply custom permissions (also known as an ad-hoc rights policy) and these permissions need to change after the document or email is protected, that content must be protected again with the new permissions. Custom permissions for an email message are implemented with the Do Not Forward option.

The default use license validity period for a tenant is 30 days and you can configure this value by using the PowerShell cmdlet, [Set-AipServiceMaxUseLicenseValidityTime](/powershell/module/aipservice/set-aipservicemaxuselicensevaliditytime). You can configure a more restrictive setting for when protection is applied by using a sensitivity label or template:

- When you configure a sensitivity label, the use license validity period takes its value from the **Allow offline access** setting. 
    
    For more information and guidance to configure this setting, see the [Information about the protection settings](configure-policy-protection.md#information-about-the-protection-settings) table from the instructions how to configure a label for Rights Management protection.

- When you configure a template by using PowerShell, the use license validity period takes its value from the *LicenseValidityDuration* parameter in the [Set-AipServiceTemplateProperty](/powershell/module/aipservice/set-aipservicetemplateproperty) and [Add-AipServiceTemplate](/powershell/module/aipservice/add-aipservicetemplate) cmdlets.
    
    For more information and guidance to configure this setting by using PowerShell, see the help for each cmdlet.

## Rights included in the default templates
