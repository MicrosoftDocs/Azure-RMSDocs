# Office 2016 and Office 2013: Configuration for clients
Because these later versions of Office  natively support Azure RMS, no client computer configuration is required to support the information rights management (IRM) features for applications such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and the Outlook Web App. All users have to do is sign in to their Office applications with their [!INCLUDE[o365_1](../includes/o365_1_md.md)] credentials and they can protect files and emails, and use files and emails that have been protected by others.
