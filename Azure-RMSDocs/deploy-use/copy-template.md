# Copy a template

>*Applies to: Azure Information Protection, Office 365*

If you want to create a new template that has very similar settings to an existing template, select the original template on the **TEMPLATES** page, click **COPY**, specify a unique name, and make the changes that you need.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you copy a template, the **Published** or **Archived** status is also copied. So if you copy a published template, its immediate status will be published, unless you change it.

You can copy custom templates and the default templates. As a best practice, copy one of the default templates instead of creating a new custom template if you want the template to grant rights to all users in your organization. This method means that you don't have to create or select multiple groups to specify all users. In this scenario however, be sure to specify a new name and description for the copied template for additional languages.
