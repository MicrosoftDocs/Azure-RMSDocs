Use the steps in the following roadmap pages as recommendations to help you prepare for, implement, and manage Azure Information Protection for your organization.

## Identify your deployment roadmap

Before deploying AIP, review the [AIP system requirements](./requirements.md).

Then, choose one of the following roadmaps, depending on your organization's needs and [subscription](/office365/servicedescriptions/microsoft-365-service-descriptions/microsoft-365-tenantlevel-services-licensing-guidance/microsoft-365-security-compliance-licensing-guidance#information-protection/):

- **Use classification, labeling, and protection**:

    Recommended for any customers with a supporting subscription. Additional capabilities include both discovering sensitive information and labeling documents and emails for classification. 

    Labels can also apply protection, simplifying this step for your users. 

    This roadmap is supported for both AIP labels created with the classic client, and sensitivity labels that use the [unified labeling platform](faqs.md#how-can-i-determine-if-my-tenant-is-on-the-unified-labeling-platform).

    For more information, see [AIP roadmap to classify, label, and protect your data](deployment-roadmap-classify-label-protect.md).

- **Use protection only**: 

    Recommended for customers with a subscription that doesn't support both classification and labels, but does support protection without labels. You must have the classic client installed.

    For more information, see [AIP roadmap for data protection only](deployment-roadmap-protect-only.md).
