### Servicing information and timelines

Each general availability (GA) version of the Azure Information Protection client is supported for up to six months after the release of the subsequent GA version. With the exception of this section, the documentation does not include information about unsupported versions of the client. Fixes and new functionality are always applied to the latest GA version and will not be applied to older GA versions.

##### General availability versions that are no longer supported:

The date format used on this page is *month/day/year*.

Starting 6/2/2019, the labeling service for Azure Information Protection requires connections that use TLS 1.2.

All client versions from 1.4.21.0 released 03/15/2017 support TLS 1.2. Client versions **1.3.155.2**, **1.2.4.0**, and **1.1.23.0** do not use TLS 1.2 and therefore can no longer download the Azure Information Protection policy.
