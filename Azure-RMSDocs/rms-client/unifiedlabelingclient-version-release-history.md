# Azure Information Protection unified labeling client - Version release history and support policy

>*Applies to: Active Directory Rights Management Services, [Azure Information Protection](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/information-protection), Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7 with SP1, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2008 R2*
>
> *Instructions for: [Azure Information Protection unified labeling client for Windows](../faqs.md#whats-the-difference-between-the-azure-information-protection-client-and-the-azure-information-protection-unified-labeling-client)*


You can download the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53018).

After a short delay of typically a couple of weeks, the latest general availability version is also included in the Microsoft Update Catalog with a product name of **Microsoft Azure Information Protection** > **Microsoft Azure Information Protection Unified Labeling Client**, and the classification of **Updates**. This inclusion in the catalog means that you can upgrade the client by using WSUS or Configuration Manager, or other software deployment mechanisms that use Microsoft Update.

For more information, see [Upgrading and maintaining the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client](clientv2-admin-guide.md#upgrading-and-maintaining-the-azure-information-protection-unified-labeling-client).

### Servicing information and timelines

Each general availability (GA) version of the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client is supported for up to six months after the release of the subsequent GA version. The documentation does not include information about unsupported versions of the client. Fixes and new functionality are always applied to the latest GA version and will not be applied to older GA versions.

Preview versions should not be deployed for end users on production networks. Instead, use the latest preview version to see and try new functionality or fixes that are coming in the next GA version. Preview versions that are not current are not supported.

> [!NOTE]
> For technical support, see the [Support options and community resources](../information-support.md#support-options-and-community-resources) information. We also invite you to engage with the Azure Information Protection team, on their [Yammer site](https://www.yammer.com/askipteam/).

### Release information

Use the following information to see what’s supported for the general availability version of the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client.

This client installs an Office add-on for Windows computers, an extension for File Explorer, and a PowerShell module. This client has the same [prerequisites](../requirements.md) as the Azure Information Protection client that downloads policy from Azure.

- Support for labels that are configured for user-defined permissions for Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and File Explorer:
    - If you have labels with this configuration from the Azure portal, they are now supported by the unified labeling client although there is currently no equivalent configuration in the admin centers.
    - When a user selects a label with this configuration, they are prompted to select users and protection settings for the document.

        -  *WhatIf* and *DiscoveryInfoTypes* - added to [Set-AIPFileClassification](/powershell/module/azureinformationprotection/set-aipfileclassification), so that this cmdlet can run in discovery mode without applying labels
    - Deprecated cmdlets: Clear-RMSAuthentication, Get-RMSFileStatus, Get-RMSServer, Get-RMSServerAuthentication, Get-RMSTemplate, Protect-RMSFile, Set-RMSServerAuthentication, Unprotect-RMSFile

- When automatic labeling is configured, the label applies the first time a document is saved.

- Default labeling supports sublabels.
