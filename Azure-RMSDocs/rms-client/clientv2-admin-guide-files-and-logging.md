# Admin Guide: Azure Information Protection unified labeling client files and client usage logging

[!INCLUDE [looking-for-mip](../includes/looking-for-mip.md)]

After you have installed the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client, you might need to know where files are located and monitor how the client is being used.

Usage logging is supported with the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client [version 2.12.62](unifiedlabelingclient-version-release-history.md#version-212620) and higher.

## Turn on usage logging

To turn on support for usage logging for both the unified labeling client and scanner, set the registry key as follows:

- Registry path: **HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MSIP\EnableLoggingAuditEventsToEventLog**
- Type: **DWORD**
- Value: **1**

## Log file locations

Client and scanner log files are located in the following locations on your unified labeling client machine:

- **\ProgramFiles (x86)\Microsoft Azure Information Protection** (64-bit operating systems only)
- **\Program Files\Microsoft Azure Information Protection** (32-bit operating systems only)
- **%localappdata%\Microsoft\MSIP**

## Client-side usage logging

> [!NOTE]
> Client-side usage logging is currently in PREVIEW. The [Azure Preview Supplemental Terms](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) include additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.
