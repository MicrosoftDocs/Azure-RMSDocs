# User Guide: Download and install the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client

[!INCLUDE [looking-for-mip](../includes/looking-for-mip.md)]

If your administrator does not install the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client for you, you can do this yourself. You must be a local administrator for your PC to install this client so that it can label and protect your documents and emails.

> [!NOTE]
> The Azure Information Protection unified labeling client requires a minimum version of Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6.2. If this is missing, the installer tries to download and install this prerequisite. When this prerequisite is installed as part of the client installation, your computer must be restarted.
