# User Guide: Remove labels and protection from files and emails that have been labeled by Azure Information Protection or protected by Rights Management

>***Applies to**: Active Directory Rights Management Services, Azure Information Protection, Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8*
>
>***Relevant for**: [Azure Information Protection classic client for Windows](../faqs.md#whats-the-difference-between-the-azure-information-protection-classic-and-unified-labeling-clients). For the unified labeling client, see the [unified labeling client user guide](client-remove-label-protection.md).*

[!INCLUDE [AIP classic client is sunset](../includes/classic-client-sunset.md)]

When the [Azure Information Protection client is installed on your computer](install-client-app.md), you can remove classification labels and protection from files and emails.

When the label that you remove is configured to apply protection, this action also removes protection from the file. You might be prompted to record why you are removing the label.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must be the owner of the file to remove protection, or been granted permissions to remove protection (the Rights Management permission of **Export** or **Full Control**).

If you want to choose a different label or a different set of protection settings, you do not need to remove the label or protection. Instead, choose a new label and if necessary, you can define custom permissions if your administrator allows this configuration. 

You can remove labels and protection from Office documents and emails when you are creating or editing them from within your Office desktop apps: **Word**, **Excel**, **PowerPoint**, **Outlook**. 

You can also remove labels and protection by using **File Explorer**, which supports additional file types and is a convenient way to remove labels and protection from multiple files at once.

## Using Office apps to remove labels and protection from documents and emails

On the Information Protection bar, click the **Delete Label** icon:

![Azure Information Protection bar - Delete Label](../media/delete-label.png)

If the **Delete Label** icon is not immediately available, first click the **Edit Label** icon:

![Azure Information Protection bar - Edit Label](../media/edit-label.png)

If you still do not see the **Delete Label** icon, your administrator does not allow you to use this option because all documents and email must have a label.

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't see this Information Protection bar in your Office apps:
>
> - If you see a **Protect** button on the ribbon: Select **Protect**, and then select **Show Bar**.
> 
> - You might not have the Azure Information Protection client [installed](install-client-app.md), or the client is running in [protection-only mode](client-protection-only-mode.md).

## Using File Explorer to remove labels and protection from files

When you use File Explorer, you can quickly remove labels and protection from a single file, multiple files, or a folder. When you select a folder, all the files in that folder and any subfolders it has are automatically selected. 

1. In File Explorer, select your file, multiple files, or a folder. Right-click, and select **Classify and protect**.

2. To remove a label: In the **Classify and protect - Azure Information Protection** dialog box, click **Delete Label**. If the label was configured to apply protection, that protection is automatically removed.

3. To remove custom protection from a single file: In the **Classify and protect - Azure Information Protection** dialog box, clear the **Protect with custom permissions** option. 
    
    If you do not see the **Protect with custom permissions** option, your administrator does not allow you to use this option.
    
4. To remove custom protection from multiple files: In the **Classify and protect - Azure Information Protection** dialog box, click **Remove custom permissions**.
    
    If you do not see the **Remove custom permissions** option, your administrator does not allow you to use this option.

5. Click **Apply** and wait for the **Work finished** message to see the results. Then click **Close**.
