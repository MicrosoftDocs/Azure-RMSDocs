The Azure Information Protection unified labeling client for Windows is a downloadable client for organizations that use [sensitivity labels](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels) to classify and protect documents and emails. This client also has a viewer for organizations that don't have their own information protection infrastructure but want to consume content that has been protected by other organizations that use a Rights Management service from Microsoft.

> [!NOTE]
> This client, also known as just the unified labeling client, is replacing the Azure Information Protection client (classic). If you're not sure which client to use, see [Choose which labeling client to use for Windows computers](use-client.md#choose-which-labeling-client-to-use-for-windows-computers).

- [User guide for the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client](clientv2-user-guide.md)
