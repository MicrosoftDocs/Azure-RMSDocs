The Azure Information Protection unified labeling client for Windows is a downloadable client for organizations that use [sensitivity labels](/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels) to classify and protect documents and emails. This client also has a viewer for organizations that don't have their own information protection infrastructure but want to consume content that has been protected by other organizations that use a Rights Management service from Microsoft.

> [!NOTE]
> This client, also known as just the unified labeling client, is replacing the Azure Information Protection classic client. If you're not sure which client to use, see [Choose your Windows labeling solution](use-client.md#choose-your-windows-labeling-solution).
