# Azure Information Protection unified labeling client for Windows

[!INCLUDE [looking-for-mip](../includes/looking-for-mip.md)]

The Azure Information Protection unified labeling client for Windows is a downloadable client for organizations that use [sensitivity labels](/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels) to classify and protect documents and emails. This client also has a viewer for organizations that don't have their own information protection infrastructure but want to consume content that has been protected by other organizations that use a Rights Management service from Microsoft.

Use the following resources for the unified labeling client:

- [Azure Information Protection unified labeling client: Version release history](unifiedlabelingclient-version-release-history.md)

- [Administrator guide for the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client](clientv2-admin-guide.md)
