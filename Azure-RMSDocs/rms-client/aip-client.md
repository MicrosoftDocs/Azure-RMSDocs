# Azure Information Protection classic client for Windows

>***Applies to**: Active Directory Rights Management Services, Azure Information Protection, Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012*
>
> ***Relevant for**: [Azure Information Protection classic client for Windows](../faqs.md#whats-the-difference-between-the-azure-information-protection-classic-and-unified-labeling-clients). For the unified labeling client, see the unified labeling client [admin guide](clientv2-admin-guide.md) and [user guide](clientv2-user-guide.md).*

[!INCLUDE [AIP classic client is sunset](../includes/classic-client-sunset.md)]

The Azure Information Protection classic client is the original downloadable client for organizations that use Azure Information Protection to classify and protect documents and emails, or use a Rights Management service to protect their data. This client also has a viewer for organizations that don't have their own information protection infrastructure but want to consume content that has been protected by other organizations that use a Rights Management service from Microsoft.

Use the following resources for the classic client:

- [Azure Information Protection client: Version release history](client-version-release-history.md)

- [Azure Information Protection client administrator guide](client-admin-guide.md)

- [Azure Information Protection user guide](client-user-guide.md)

> [!TIP]
> There's also an Azure Information Protection app for iOS and Android. For more information, see [FAQs for Azure Information Protection app for iOS and Android](mobile-app-faq.md )
> 
> For Mac computers: Use the RMS sharing app and read the [FAQ for Rights Management Sharing Application for Mobile and Mac Platforms](/previous-versions/msdn10/dn451248(v=msdn.10)).


## Supported features

The this section lists the features supported by the classic client, in parallel with the comparison section for the unified labeling client and built-in labeling solution in [Learn about about built-in labeling and the AIP unified labeling client](use-client.md).
