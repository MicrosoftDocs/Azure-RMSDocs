# Get started with the Microsoft Azure Information Protection app for iOS and Android

*Applies to: Active Directory Rights Management Services, [Azure Information Protection](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/information-protection)*

Before you use the instructions on this page, make sure that you've read the [FAQs for the Azure Information Protection app for iOS and Android](mobile-app-faq.md). That page explains what the app is for, which devices are supported, and basic information about how to use the app.

Most users will typically use the Azure Information Protection app when they need to open a protected email or file. But if you are an admin who wants to test the app for your users, or simply want to try it out before you need it, you can use the following instructions.

> [!NOTE]
> You do not first open the app and then select documents and emails to view. Instead, you open your document or email, and then select this app to view your document or email.
>
> Similarly, do not try to sign in to the app until you are prompted.

To use the following instructions, you need access from your mobile device to one of the files that the app supports. For example:

- **A .rpmsg file**: This is a rights-protected email message that displays as an attachment in an email message when your email app on your mobile device does not natively support rights management data protection. 
    
    Use another device to send yourself a rights-protected email message that you can access from your mobile device. For example, use Outlook from a Windows computer. For a list of email clients that natively support rights management, see the EMAIL column from the [Applications that support Azure Rights Management data protection](../requirements-applications.md) page.

- **A rights-protected PDF file**: From a Windows computer, use the Azure Information Protection client to [protect a PDF file](client-classify-protect.md) and then send yourself this rights-protected PDF file as an attachment in email. Alternatively, upload a PDF file to a SharePoint protected library and then share it, using your email address.

- **A .ptxt or .pjpg or .ppng**: From a Windows computer, use the Azure Information Protection client to protect a text or image file and then send yourself this protected file as an email attachment. For the full list of file types that you can use for testing, see the first table in the [Supported file types for classification and protection](client-admin-guide-file-types.md#supported-file-types-for-classification-and-protection) section from the Azure Information Protection client administration guide. 

To view these files in the Azure Information Protection viewer app, tap the email attachment or link. When you're prompted to select an app to open them with, select the **AIP Viewer** app. You will then be asked to sign in with your work or school account, or prompted to select a certificate. After these credentials are authenticated, the Azure Information Protection app displays the email or file for you to read.
