Before you install the Azure Information Protection client on your enterprise network, check that computers have the required operating system versions and applications for Azure Information Protection: [Requirements for Azure Information Protection](../requirements.md).

Then check the additional prerequisites that might be needed for the Azure Information Protection client, as documented in the next section. Not all the prerequisites are checked by the installation program.

## Additional prerequisites for the Azure Information Protection client

- **Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6.2**

    The full installation of the Azure Information Protection client by default, requires a minimum version of Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6.2 and if this is missing, the setup wizard from the executable installer tries to download and install this prerequisite. When this prerequisite is installed as part of the client installation, the computer must be restarted. Although not recommended, you can bypass this prerequisite when you use the setup wizard by using a [custom installation parameter](#more-information-about-the-downgradedotnetrequirement-installation-parameter).

    This prerequisite is not automatically installed when you install the client silently by using the executable installer, Windows Update, or Windows installer. For these scenarios, you must install this prerequisite separately if it is needed, or the install fails. You can download the Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6.2 (Offline Installer) from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=53344).

- **Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.2**

    If the Azure Information Protection Viewer is installed separately, this requires a minimum version of Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.2 and if this is missing, the executable installer does not download or install it.

- **Windows PowerShell minimum version 4.0**

    The PowerShell module for the client requires a minimum version of 4.0 for Windows PowerShell, which might need to be installed on older operating systems. For more information, see [How to Install Windows PowerShell 4.0](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/21016.how-to-install-windows-powershell-4-0.aspx). The installer does not check or install this prerequisite for you. To confirm the version of Windows PowerShell that you are running, type `$PSVersionTable` in a PowerShell session.

- **Screen resolution greater than 800x600**

    Resolutions 800x600 and lower can't fully display the **Classify and protect - Azure Information Protection** dialog box when you right-click a file or folder in File Explorer.

- **Microsoft Online Services Sign-in Assistant 7.250.4303.0**

    Computers running Office 2010 require Microsoft Online Services Sign-in Assistant version 7.250.4303.0. This version is included with the client installation. 

    If you have a later version of the Sign-in Assistant, uninstall it before you install the Azure Information Protection client. For example, check the version and uninstall the Sign-in Assistant by using **Control Panel** > **Program and Features** > **Uninstall or change a program**.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Office 2010 extended support ended on October 13, 2020. For more information, see [AIP and legacy Windows and Office versions](../removed-sunset-services.md#aip-and-legacy-windows-and-office-sharepoint-and-exchange-versions).
    >

- **KB 4482887**

    For Windows 10 version 1809 only, operation system builds older than 17763.348, install [March 1, 2019â€”KB4482887 (OS Build 17763.348)](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4482887/windows-10-update-kb4482887) to ensure the Information Protection bar displays correctly in Office applications. This update is not needed if you have Office 365 1902 or later.

- **Configure group policy to prevent the Azure Information Protection add-in from being disabled**

    For Office 2013 and later versions, configure group policy to ensure that the **Microsoft Azure Information Protection** add-in for Office applications is always enabled. Without this configuration, the Microsoft Azure Information Protection add-in can get disabled and users will not be able to label their documents and emails in their Office application.

    - **For Outlook:** Use the group policy setting documented in [System Administrator control over add-ins](/office/vba/outlook/concepts/getting-started/support-for-keeping-add-ins-enabled#system-administrator-control-over-add-ins) from the Office documentation.

    - **For Word, Excel, and PowerPoint:** Use the group policy setting **list of managed add-ins** documented in the Support article [No Add-ins loaded due to group policy settings for Office 2013 and Office 2016 programs](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2733070/no-add-ins-loaded-due-to-group-policy-settings-for-office-2013-and-off).

        Specify the following programmatic identifiers (ProgID) for Azure Information Protection, and set the option to **1: The add-in is always enabled**.

        **For Word:** `MSIP.WordAddin`

        **For Excel:** `MSIP.ExcelAddin`

        **For PowerPoint:** `MSIP.PowerPointAddin`

- **Exploit protection.** 

    The AIP client is not supported on machines with .NET versions 2 or 3 that have [Exploit protection](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/enable-exploit-protection) enabled. If your machine has .NET version 2 or 3 in addition to a .NET 4.x version listed above, make sure to [disable Exploit protection](../known-issues.md#known-issues-for-aip-and-exploit-protection) before installing the AIP client.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Installation of the Azure Information Protection client requires local administrative permissions.

## Options to install the Azure Information Protection client for users

Use one of the following options to install the client for users:

|Install option  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Run the client executable (.exe)**  <br><br> [Instructions](#to-install-the-azure-information-protection-client-by-using-the-executable-installer)      | We recommend running the .exe version of the client to run the installation interactively or silently.<br><br> Running the .exe file has the most flexibility, and is recommended because it also checks for many of the prerequisites and can also install any prerequisites that are missing. |
|**Deploy the client's Windows installer (.msi)** <br><br> [Instructions](#to-install-the-azure-information-protection-client-by-using-the-msi-installer)    | The Azure Information Protection client Windows installer is supported for silent installations only that use a central deployment mechanism.<br><br> For example, use the .msi file when deploying with a group policy, Configuration Manager, and Microsoft Intune.<br><br> You must use this method for Windows 10 PCs that are managed by Intune and mobile device management (MDM) as .exe files are not supported for these computers.<br><br>**Note**: When using the .msi installation, you must manually check for prerequisites and install or uninstall any dependent software required. |

After installing the client, perform updates by repeating the same installation method, or use Windows Update to keep the client updated automatically. You are not required to uninstall legacy versions of the client before installing a new version.

For more information, see [Upgrading and maintaining the Azure Information Protection client](client-admin-guide.md#upgrading-and-maintaining-the-azure-information-protection-client).

> [!NOTE]
> To uninstall the client, use the Windows **Add or remove programs** option, such as [from the Windows Control Panel](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4028054/windows-10-repair-or-remove-programs).

### To install the Azure Information Protection client by using the executable installer

Use the following instructions to install the client when you're not using the Microsoft Update catalog, or deploying the .msi by using a central deployment method such as Intune.

1. For a default installation, simply run the executable, for example, **AzInfoProtection.exe**. 

    To view other installation options, first run the executable with **/help**: `AzInfoProtection.exe /help`

    Example to silently install the client: `AzInfoProtection.exe /quiet`

    Example to silently install only the PowerShell cmdlets: `AzInfoProtection.exe  PowerShellOnly=true /quiet`

    Additional parameters that are not listed on the help screen:
 
    - **DowngradeDotNetRequirement**: Use this parameter to bypass the requirement for Microsoft Framework .NET version 4.6.2. [More information](#more-information-about-the-downgradedotnetrequirement-installation-parameter)

    - **AllowTelemetry=0**: Use this parameter to disable the install option **Help improve Azure Information Protection by sending usage statistics to Microsoft**.

    - **ServiceLocation**: Use this parameter if you are installing the client on computers that run Office 2010 and your users are not local administrators on their computers or you do not want them to be prompted.  For more information, see [More information about the ServiceLocation installation parameter](#more-information-about-the-servicelocation-installation-parameter). 
    
        > [!IMPORTANT]
        > Office 2010 extended support ended on October 13, 2020. For more information, see [AIP and legacy Windows and Office versions](../removed-sunset-services.md#aip-and-legacy-windows-and-office-sharepoint-and-exchange-versions).
        >

1. If you are installing interactively, select the option to install a **demo policy** if you cannot connect to Microsoft 365 or Azure Active Directory, but want to see and experience the client side of Azure Information Protection by using a local policy for demonstration purposes. When your client connects to an Azure Information Protection service, this demo policy is replaced with your organization's Azure Information Protection policy.

1. To complete the installation, restart any Office applications and all instances of File Explorer.

    **Office 2010 only**: If your computer runs [Office 2010](../removed-sunset-services.md#aip-and-legacy-windows-and-office-sharepoint-and-exchange-versions), restart your computer. If the client was not installed with the **ServiceLocation** parameter, when you first open one of the Office applications that use the Azure Information Protection bar (for example, Word), you must confirm any prompts to update the registry for this first-time use. [Service discovery](client-deployment-notes.md#rms-service-discovery) is used to populate the registry keys.
    

1. You can confirm that the installation was successful by checking the install log file, which by default is created in the %temp% folder. You can change this location with the **/log** installation parameter.

    This file has the following naming format: `Microsoft_Azure_Information_Protection_<number>_<number>_MSIP.Setup.Main.msi.log`

    For example: **Microsoft_Azure_Information_Protection_20161201093652_000_MSIP.Setup.Main.msi.log**

    In this log file, search for the following string: **Product: Microsoft Azure Information Protection -- Installation completed successfully.** If the installation failed, this log file contains details to help you identify and resolve any problems.

#### More information about the ServiceLocation installation parameter

When you install the client for users who have Office 2010 and they do not have local administrative permissions, specify the **ServiceLocation** parameter and the URL for your Azure Rights Management service. 

    
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Office 2010 extended support ended on October 13, 2020. For more information, see [AIP and legacy Windows and Office versions](../removed-sunset-services.md#aip-and-legacy-windows-and-office-sharepoint-and-exchange-versions).
>

This parameter and value creates and sets the following registry keys:

`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\MSDRM\ServiceLocation\Activation`

`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\MSDRM\ServiceLocation\EnterprisePublishing`

`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MSDRM\ServiceLocation\EnterprisePublishing`

`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MSDRM\ServiceLocation\Activation`

Use the [following procedure](#to-identify-the-value-to-specify-for-the-servicelocation-parameter) to identify the value to specify for the **ServiceLocation** parameter.

##### To identify the value to specify for the ServiceLocation parameter

1. From a PowerShell session, first run [Connect-AipService](/powershell/module/aipservice/connect-aipservice) and specify your administrator credentials to connect to the Azure Rights Management service. Then run [Get-AipServiceConfiguration](/powershell/module/aipservice/get-aipserviceconfiguration).

    If you haven't already installed the PowerShell module for the Azure Rights Management service, see [Installing the AIPService PowerShell module](../install-powershell.md).

2. From the output, identify the **LicensingIntranetDistributionPointUrl** value.

    For example: **LicensingIntranetDistributionPointUrl   : https://5c6bb73b-1038-4eec-863d-49bded473437.rms.na.aadrm.com/_wmcs/licensing**

3. From the value, remove **/_wmcs/licensing** from this string. For example: **https://5c6bb73b-1038-4eec-863d-49bded473437.rms.na.aadrm.com**

    The remaining string is the value to specify for your **ServiceLocation** parameter.

Example to install the client silently for [Office 2010](../removed-sunset-services.md#aip-and-legacy-windows-and-office-sharepoint-and-exchange-versions) and Azure RMS: 

`AzInfoProtection_UL.exe /quiet ServiceLocation=https://5c6bb73b-1038-4eec-863d-49bded473437.rms.na.aadrm.com`

#### More information about the DowngradeDotNetRequirement installation parameter

To support automatic upgrades by using Windows Update, and for reliable integration with Office applications, the Azure Information Protection client uses Microsoft .NET Framework version 4.6.2. By default, an interactive installation by using the executable checks for this version and tries to install it if it is missing. The installation then requires the computer to restart.

If installing this later version of the Microsoft .NET Framework is not practical, you can install the client with the **DowngradeDotNetRequirement=True** parameter and value, which bypasses this requirement if Microsoft .NET Framework version 4.5.1 is installed.

For example: `AzInfoProtection.exe DowngradeDotNetRequirement=True`

We recommend that you use this parameter with caution, and with the knowledge that there are reported issues with Office applications hanging when the Azure Information Protection client is used with this older version of the Microsoft .NET Framework. If you do experience hanging problems, upgrade to the recommended version before you try other troubleshooting solutions. 

Also remember that if you use Windows Update to keep the Azure Information Protection client updated, you must have another software deployment mechanism to upgrade the client to later versions.

### To install the Azure Information Protection client by using the .msi installer

For central deployment, use the following information that is specific to the .msi installation version of the Azure Information Protection client. 

If you use Intune for your software deployment method, use these instructions together with [Add apps with Microsoft Intune](/intune/apps/apps-add).

1. For each computer that runs the **.msi** file, you must make sure that the following software dependencies are in place. For example, package these with the **.msi** version of the client or only deploy to computers that meet these dependencies:
    
    |Office version|Operating system|Software|Action|

## How to install the Azure Information Protection scanner

The PowerShell module that is included with the Azure Information Protection client has cmdlets to install and configure the scanner. However, to use the scanner, you must install the full version of the client and cannot install just the PowerShell module.

To install the client for the scanner, follow the same instructions in the preceding sections. You're then ready to configure and then install the scanner. For more information, see [What is the Azure Information Protection classic scanner?](../deploy-aip-scanner-classic.md).

## Next steps

Now that you've installed the Azure Information Protection client, see the following for additional information that you might need to support this client:

- [Customizations](client-admin-guide-customizations.md)

- [Client files and usage logging](client-admin-guide-files-and-logging.md)

- [Document tracking](client-admin-guide-document-tracking.md)

- [File types supported](client-admin-guide-file-types.md)

- [PowerShell commands](client-admin-guide-powershell.md)
