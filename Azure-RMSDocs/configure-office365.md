# Office 365: Configuration for clients and online services to use the Azure Rights Management service

>*Applies to: [Azure Information Protection](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/information-protection), [Office 365](https://download.microsoft.com/download/E/C/F/ECF42E71-4EC0-48FF-AA00-577AC14D5B5C/Azure_Information_Protection_licensing_datasheet_EN-US.pdf)*

Because Office 365 natively supports the Azure Rights Management service from Azure Information Protection, no client computer configuration is required to support the information rights management (IRM) features for applications such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Outlook on the web. All users have to do, is sign in to their Office applications with their Rights Management credentials. Then, they can protect files and emails, and use files and emails that have been protected by others.

However, we recommend that you supplement these applications with the Azure Information Protection client, so that users get the benefit of the Office add-in and support for additional file types. For more information, see [Azure Information Protection client: Installation and configuration for clients](configure-client.md).

## Exchange Online: IRM Configuration
For information about how Exchange Online IRM works with the Azure Rights Management service, see the [Exchange Online and Exchange Server](office-apps-services-support.md#exchange-online-and-exchange-server) section from [How Office applications and services support Azure Rights Management](office-apps-services-support.md).

Exchange Online might already be enabled to use the Azure Rights Management service. To check, run the following commands:

1. If this is the first time that you have used Windows PowerShell for Exchange Online on your computer, you must configure Windows PowerShell to run signed scripts. Start your Windows PowerShell session by using the **Run as administrator** option, and then type:
    
    	Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
    
    Press **Y** to confirm.

2. In your Windows PowerShell session, sign in to Exchange Online by using an account that is enabled for remote Shell access. By default, all accounts that are created in Exchange Online are enabled for remote Shell access but this can be disabled  (and enabled) by using the [Set-User &lt;UserIdentity&gt; -RemotePowerShellEnabled](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj984292%28v=exchg.160%29.aspx) command.
    
    To sign in, first type:
    
    	$Cred = Get-Credential
   
    Then, in the **Windows PowerShell credential request** dialog box, supply your Office 365 user name and password.

3. Connect to the Exchange Online service by first setting a variable:
    
    	$Session = New-PSSession -ConfigurationName Microsoft.Exchange -ConnectionUri https://ps.outlook.com/powershell/ -Credential $Cred -Authentication Basic –AllowRedirection
    
    Then run the following command:
    
    	Import-PSSession $Session

4. Run the [Get-IRMConfiguration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd776120(v=exchg.160).aspx) command to view your Exchange Online configuration for the protection service:
    
    	Get-IRMConfiguration
    
    From the output, locate the **AzureRMSLicensingEnabled** value:
    
    - If AzureRMSLicensingEnabled is set to **True**, Exchange Online is already enabled for the Azure Rights Management service. 
    
    - If AzureRMSLicensingEnabled is set **False**, run the follow command to enable Exchange Online for the Azure Rights Management service: `Set-IRMConfiguration -AzureRMSLicensingEnabled $true`

5. To test that Exchange Online is configured successfully, run the following command:
    ```
    Test-IRMConfiguration -Sender <user email address>
    ```
    For example: <strong>Test-IRMConfiguration -Sender  adams@contoso.com</strong>
    
    This command runs a series of checks that includes verifying connectivity to the service, retrieving the configuration, retrieving URIs, licenses, and any templates. In the Windows PowerShell session, you will see the results of each and at the end, if everything passes these checks: **OVERALL RESULT: PASS**

When Exchange Online is enabled to use the Azure Rights Management service, you can configure features that apply information protection automatically, such as [mail flow rules](https://support.office.com/article/define-mail-flow-rules-to-encrypt-email-messages-in-office-365-9b7daf19-d5f2-415b-bc43-a0f5f4a585e8), [data loss prevention (DLP) policies](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj150527%28v=exchg.150%29.aspx), and [protected voice mail](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn198211%28v=exchg.150%29.aspx) (Unified Messaging).

## SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business: IRM Configuration

For information about how SharePoint Online IRM works with the Azure Rights Management service, see [SharePoint Online and SharePoint Server](office-apps-services-support.md#sharepoint-online-and-sharepoint-server) from the **Understand & Explore** section.

To configure SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business to support the Azure Rights Management service, you must first enable the information rights management (IRM) service for SharePoint Online by using the SharePoint admin center. Then, site owners can  IRM-protect their SharePoint lists and document libraries, and users can IRM-protect their OneDrive for Business library so that documents that are saved there, and shared with others, are automatically protected by the Azure Rights Management service.

> [!NOTE]
> IRM-protected libraries for SharePoint and OneDrive for Business require the latest version of the new OneDrive sync client (OneDrive.exe), and the version of the [RMS client from the Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=38396). Install this version of the RMS client even if you have installed the Azure Information Protection client. For more information about this deployment scenario, see [Deploy the new OneDrive sync client in an enterprise environment](https://support.office.com/article/Deploy-the-new-OneDrive-sync-client-in-an-enterprise-environment-3f3a511c-30c6-404a-98bf-76f95c519668).

To enable the information rights management (IRM) service for SharePoint Online, see the following instructions from the Office website:

- [Set up Information Rights Management (IRM) in SharePoint admin center](/office365/securitycompliance/set-up-irm-in-sp-admin-center)

This configuration is done by the Office 365 administrator.

### Configuring IRM for libraries and lists
After you have enabled the IRM service for SharePoint, site owners can IRM-protect their SharePoint document libraries and lists. For instructions, see the following from the Office website:

- [Apply Information Rights Management to a list or library](https://office.microsoft.com/sharepoint-help/apply-information-rights-management-to-a-list-or-library-HA102891460.aspx)

This configuration is done by the SharePoint site administrator.

### Configuring IRM for OneDrive for Business
After you have enabled the IRM service for SharePoint Online, users' OneDrive for Business document library or individual folders can then be configured for Rights Management protection. Users can configure this for themselves by using their OneDrive website. Although administrators cannot configure this protection for them by using the SharePoint admin center, you can do this by using Windows PowerShell.

> [!NOTE]
> For more information about configuring OneDrive for Business, see the Office documentation, [Set up OneDrive for Business in Office 365](https://support.office.com/article/Set-up-OneDrive-for-Business-in-Office-365-3e21f8f0-e0a1-43be-aa3e-8c0236bf11bb).

#### Configuration for users
Give users the following instructions so that they can configure their OneDrive for Business to protect their business files.

1. Sign in to Office 365 with your work or school account and go to the [OneDrive website](https://portal.office.com/onedrive).

2. In the navigation pane, at the bottom, select **Return to classic OneDrive**.

3. Select the **Settings** icon. In the **Settings** pane, if the **Ribbon** is set to **Off**, select this setting to turn the ribbon on.

4. To configure all OneDrive for Business files to be protected, select the **LIBRARY** tab from the ribbon, and then select **Library Settings**.

5. On the **Documents > Settings** page, in the **Permissions and Management** section, select **Information Rights Management**.

6. On the **Information Rights Management Settings** page, select **Restrict permissions on this library on download** check box. Specify your choice of  name and a description for the permissions, and optionally, click **SHOW OPTIONS** to configure optional configurations, and then click **OK**.

    For more information about the configuration options, see the instructions in [Apply Information Rights Management to a list or library](https://support.office.com/article/Apply-Information-Rights-Management-to-a-list-or-library-3bdb5c4e-94fc-4741-b02f-4e7cc3c54aa1) from the Office documentation.

Because this configuration relies on users rather than an administrator to IRM-protect their OneDrive for Business files, educate users about the  benefits of protecting their files and how to do this. For example, explain that when they share a document from OneDrive for Business, only people they authorize can access it with any restrictions that they configure, even if the file is renamed and copied somewhere else.

#### Configuration for administrators
Although you cannot configure IRM for users' OneDrive for Business by using the SharePoint admin center, you can do this by using Windows PowerShell. To enable IRM for these libraries, follow these steps:

1. Download and install the [SharePoint Online Client Components SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42038).

2. Download and install the [SharePoint Online Management Shell](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35588).

3. Copy the contents of the following script and name the file Set-IRMOnOneDriveForBusiness.ps1 on your computer.

   *&#42;&#42;Disclaimer&#42;&#42;*: This sample script is not supported under any Microsoft standard support program or service. This sample script is provided AS IS without warranty of any kind.

   Disconnect-SPOService -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
   ```

4. Review the script and make the following changes:

   1. Search for `$sharepointAdminCenterUrl` and replace the example value with your own SharePoint admin center URL.

      You'll find this value as the base URL when you go into the SharePoint admin center, and it has the following format: https://<em>&lt;tenant_name&gt;</em>-admin.sharepoint.com

      For example, if the tenant name is "contoso", then you would specify: **https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com**

   2. Search for `$tenantAdmin` and replace the example value with your own fully qualified global administrator account for Office 365.

      This value is the same as the one you use to sign in to the Office 365 admin portal as the global administrator and has the following format: user_name@*&lt;tenant domain name&gt;*.com

      For example, if the Office 365 global administrator user name is "admin" for the "contoso.com" tenant domain, you would specify: <strong>admin@contoso.com</strong>

   3. Search for `$webUrls` and replace the example values with your users' OneDrive for Business web URLs, adding or deleting as many entries as you need.

      Alternatively, see the comments in the script about how to replace this array by importing a .CSV file that contains all the URLs you need to configure.  We've provided another sample script to automatically search for and extract the URLs to populate this .CSV file. When you're ready to do this, use the [Additional script to output all OneDrive for Business URLs to a .CSV file](#additional-script-to-output-all-onedrive-for-business-urls-to-a-csv-file) section immediately after these steps.

      The web URL for the user's OneDrive for Business is in the following format: https://<em>&lt;tenant name&gt;</em>-my.sharepoint.com/personal/*&lt;user_name&gt;*_*&lt;tenant name&gt;*_com

      For example, if the user in the contoso tenant has a user name of "rsimone", you would specify: **https://contoso-my.sharepoint.com/personal/rsimone_contoso_com**

   4. Because we are using the script to configure OneDrive for Business, do not change the value of **Documents** for the `$listTitle` variable.

   5. Search for `ADMIN INSTRUCTIONS`. If you make no changes to this section, the user's OneDrive for Business will be configured for IRM with the policy title of "Protected Files" and the description of "This policy restricts access to authorized users".  No other IRM options will be set, which is probably appropriate for most environments. However, you can change the suggested policy title and description, and also add any other IRM options that are appropriate for your environment. See the commented example in the script to help you construct your own set of parameters for the Set-IrmConfiguration command.

5. Save the script and sign it. If you do not sign the script (more secure), Windows PowerShell must be configured on your computer to run unsigned scripts. To do this, run a Windows PowerShell session with the **Run as Administrator** option, and type: **Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted**. However, this configuration lets all unsigned scripts run (less secure).

   For more information about signing Windows PowerShell scripts, see [about_Signing](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh847874.aspx) in the PowerShell documentation library.

6. Run the script and if prompted, supply the password for the Office 365 admin account. If you modify the script and run it in the same Windows PowerShell session, you won't be prompted for credentials.

> [!TIP]
> You can also use this script to configure IRM for a SharePoint Online library. For this configuration, you will likely want to enable the additional option **Do not allow users to upload documents that do not support IRM**, to ensure that the library contains only protected documents.    To do that, add the `-IrmReject` parameter to the Set-IrmConfiguration command in the script.
>
> You would also need to modify the `$webUrls` variable (for example, **https://contoso.sharepoint.com**) and  `$listTitle` variable (for example, **$Reports**).

If you need to disable IRM for user's OneDrive for Business libraries, see the [Script to disable IRM for OneDrive for Business](#script-to-disable-irm-for-onedrive-for-business) section.

##### Additional script to output all OneDrive for Business URLs to a .CSV file
For step 4c above, you can use the following Windows PowerShell script to extract the URLs for all users' OneDrive for Business libraries, which you can then check, edit if necessary, and then import into the main script.

This script also requires the [SharePoint Online Client Components SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42038) and the [SharePoint Online Management Shell](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35588). Follow the same instructions to copy and paste it, save the file locally (for example, "Report-OneDriveForBusinessSiteInfo.ps1"), modify the   `$sharepointAdminCenterUrl` and `$tenantAdmin` values as before, and then run the script.

##### Script to disable IRM for OneDrive for Business
Use the following sample script if you need to disable IRM for users' OneDrive for Business.

This script also requires the [SharePoint Online Client Components SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42038) and the [SharePoint Online Management Shell](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35588). Copy and paste the contents, save the file locally (for example, "Disable-IRMOnOneDriveForBusiness.ps1"), and modify the `$sharepointAdminCenterUrl` and `$tenantAdmin` values. Manually specify the OneDrive for Business URLs or use the script in the previous section so that you can import these, and then run the script.
