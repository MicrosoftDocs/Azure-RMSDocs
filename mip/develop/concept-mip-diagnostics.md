# Microsoft Information Protection SDK - Diagnostic Configuration

## Diagnostic Data

By default, the Microsoft Information Protection SDK sends diagnostic data to Microsoft. This data is useful for troubleshooting bugs, quality, and performance issues across the SDK install base that we may not capture in our internal testing. When implementing your application with the SDK, it's important to give users and admins the ability to opt out of sending diagnostic data if required.

## Diagnostic Configuration

Diagnostic options in the MIP SDK can be controlled via `DiagnosticConfiguration`. Create an instance of this class, then set **isMinimalTelemetryEnabled** to true. Provide the object of class **DiagnosticConfiguration** to the function used to create **MipContext**.

### Minimum Diagnostic Events

When diagnostic configuration is set to minimum, a minimum set of data is sent to Microsoft. All personally identifiable information is scrubbed from this information. This data includes heartbeat information to understand that the SDK is being used, and system metadata. **No user content or end user identifiable information is set to the service.**

Review the tables below to see exactly what events and data are sent with minimum diagnostics enabled.

### Opting out in C++

To set diagnostics to minimum only, create a shared pointer of **mip::DiagnosticConfiguration()** and set **isMinimalTelemetryEnabled** to true. Pass the object to `MipConfiguration::SetDiagnosticConfiguration()` then use the `MipConfiguration` to generate `MipContext`.

```cpp
auto diagnosticConfig = std::make_shared<mip::DiagnosticConfiguration>();
diagnosticConfig->isMinimalTelemetryEnabled = true;
					   
// Create MipConfiguration. 
// Initialize MipConfiguration.
std::shared_ptr<mip::MipConfiguration> mipConfiguration = std::make_shared<mip::MipConfiguration>(mAppInfo,
                                                                                                 "file_sample",
				                                                                                 mip::LogLevel::Trace,
				                                                                                 false);

// Set DiagnosticConfig
mipConfiguration->SetDiagnosticConfiguration(diagnosticConfig);

mMipContext = mip::MipContext::Create(mipConfiguration);
```

### Opting out in .NET

To set diagnostic data to minimum only, create a **DiagnosticConfiguration()** object and set **isMinimalTelemetryEnabled** to true. Set the `DiagnosticOverride` property on `MipConfiguration` then create the `MipContext`.

```csharp
DiagnosticConfiguration diagnosticConfiguration = new DiagnosticConfiguration();
diagnosticConfiguration.IsMinimalTelemetryEnabled = true;

// Create MipConfiguration.
MipConfiguration mipConfiguration = new MipConfiguration(appInfo, "mip_data", LogLevel.Trace, false);

// Set Diagnostic Override.
mipConfiguration.DiagnosticOverride = diagnosticConfiguration;

// Create MipContext.
MipContext mipContext = MIP.CreateMipContext(mipConfiguration);

```
