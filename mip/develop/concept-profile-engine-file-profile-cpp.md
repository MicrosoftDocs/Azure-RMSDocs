# Microsoft Information Protection SDK - File SDK profile concepts

The profile is the root class for all operations in the MIP SDK. Before using any of the File SDK functionality, a `FileProfile` must be created and all future operations will be performed by the profile or by other objects *added* to the profile.

There are a few code-prerequisites that should be met prior to attempting to instantiate a profile:

- `MipContext` has been created and stored in an object accessible to the `mip::FileProfile` object.
- `ConsentDelegateImpl` implements `mip::ConsentDelegate`.
- The application has been [registered in Azure Active Directory](/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-v1-integrate-apps-with-azure-ad) and the client ID is hard-coded in to the application or configuration files.
- A class inheriting `mip::FileProfile::Observer` has been appropriately implemented.

## Load a Profile

With the `ProfileObserver`, and `ConsentDelegateImpl`, defined, `mip::FileProfile` can now be instantiated. Creating the `mip::FileProfile` object requires [`mip::MipContext`] to have and [`mip::FileProfile::Settings`](reference/class_mip_fileprofile_settings.md) to store all of the settings information about the `FileProfile`.

### FileProfile::Settings Parameters

The `FileProfile::Settings` constructor accepts five parameters, listed below:

- `std::shared_ptr<MipContext>`: The `mip::MipContext` object that was initialized to store application info, state path, etc.
- `mip::CacheStorageType`: Defines how to store state: In memory, on disk, or on disk and encrypted.
- `std::shared_ptr<mip::ConsentDelegate>`: A shared pointer of class [`mip::ConsentDelegate`](reference/class_mip_consentdelegate.md).
- `std::shared_ptr<mip::FileProfile::Observer> observer`: A shared pointer to the profile `Observer` implementation (in [`PolicyProfile`](reference/class_mip_policyprofile_observer.md), [`ProtectionProfile`](reference/class_mip_protectionprofile_observer.md), and [`FileProfile`](reference/class_mip_fileprofile_observer.md)).

The following examples show how to create the `profileSettings` object using local storage for state storage as well as in-memory only. 

#### Store state in memory only

```cpp
mip::ApplicationInfo appInfo {clientId, "APP NAME", "1.2.3" };

std::shared_ptr<mip::MipConfiguration> mipConfiguration = std::make_shared<mip::MipConfiguration>(mAppInfo,
			                                                                                      "mip_data",
                                                                                       			  mip::LogLevel::Trace,
                                                                                                  false);

std::shared_ptr<mip::MipContext> mMipContext = mip::MipContext::Create(mipConfiguration);

FileProfile::Settings profileSettings(
    mMipContext,                                  // mipContext object
    mip::CacheStorageType::InMemory,              // use in memory storage
    std::make_shared<ConsentDelegateImpl>(),      // new consent delegate
    std::make_shared<FileProfileObserverImpl>()); // new protection profile observer
```

#### Read/write profile settings from storage path on disk

The following code snip will instruct the `FileProfile` to store all app state data in `./mip_app_data`.

```cpp
mip::ApplicationInfo appInfo {clientId, "APP NAME", "1.2.3" };

std::shared_ptr<mip::MipConfiguration> mipConfiguration = std::make_shared<mip::MipConfiguration>(mAppInfo,
				                                                                                  "mip_data",
                                                                                        		  mip::LogLevel::Trace,
                                                                                                  false);

std::shared_ptr<mip::MipContext> mMipContext = mip::MipContext::Create(mipConfiguration);

FileProfile::Settings profileSettings(
    mMipContext,                                   // mipContext object
    mip::CacheStorageType::OnDisk,                 // use on disk storage    
    std::make_shared<ConsentDelegateImpl>(),       // new consent delegate
    std::make_shared<FileProfileObserverImpl>());  // new protection profile observer
```

#### Load the Profile

Using either approach details above, now use the promise/future pattern to load the `FileProfile`.

```cpp
auto profilePromise = std::make_shared<std::promise<std::shared_ptr<FileProfile>>>();
auto profileFuture = profilePromise->get_future();
FileProfile::LoadAsync(profileSettings, profilePromise);
```

If we've loaded a profile, and that operation was successful, `ProfileObserver::OnLoadSuccess`, our implementation of `mip::FileProfile::Observer::OnLoadSuccess` is called. The resulting object or exception pointer, as well as the context, are passed in as parameters to the function. The context is a pointer to the `std::promise` we created to handle the async operation. The function simply sets the value of the promise to the FileProfile object that was passed in for the first parameter. When the main function uses `Future.get()`, the result can be stored in a new object.

```cpp
//get the future value and store in profile. 
auto profile = profileFuture.get();
```

### Putting it Together

Having fully implemented the observers and authentication delegate, it's now possible to fully load a profile. The code snip below assumes all necessary headers are already included.

```cpp
int main()
{
    const string userName = "MyTestUser@contoso.com";
    const string password = "P@ssw0rd!";
    const string clientId = "MyClientId";

    mip::ApplicationInfo appInfo {clientId, "APP NAME", "1.2.3" };

    std::shared_ptr<mip::MipConfiguration> mipConfiguration = std::make_shared<mip::MipConfiguration>(mAppInfo,
				                                                                                      "mip_data",
                                                                                        			  mip::LogLevel::Trace,
                                                                                                      false);

    std::shared_ptr<mip::MipContext> mMipContext = mip::MipContext::Create(mipConfiguration);

    FileProfile::Settings profileSettings(
        mMipContext,                                   // MipContext object
        mip::CacheStorageType::OnDisk,                 // use on disk storage        
        std::make_shared<ConsentDelegateImpl>(),       // new consent delegate
        std::make_shared<FileProfileObserverImpl>());  // new file profile observer

        auto profilePromise = std::make_shared<promise<shared_ptr<FileProfile>>>();
        auto profileFuture = profilePromise->get_future();
        FileProfile::LoadAsync(profileSettings, profilePromise);
        auto profile = profileFuture.get();
}
```

The end result being that we've successfully loaded the profile and stored in the object called `profile`.

## Next Steps

Now that the profile has been added, the next step is to add an engine to the profile.
