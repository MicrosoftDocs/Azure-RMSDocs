# FIPS 140-2 Compliance

The Microsoft Information Protection SDK uses FIPS 140-2 approved ciphers but not FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic libraries today. Developers building applications consuming the MIP SDK need to be aware the SDK is not considered FIPS compliant at this time.

## Plans for Reaching FIPS 140-2 Compliance

The Microsoft Information Protection SDK uses OpenSSL 1.1.1 to implement all cryptographic operations. The OpenSSL team has announced plans to have OpenSSL 3.0 FIPS 140-2 validated. The MIP SDK team will update to OpenSSL 3.0 in the SDK release immediately following OpenSSL 3.0 availability. FIPS 140-2 compliance will be achieved when the OpenSSL team has completed FIPS validation efforts.

## TLS Requirements

MIP SDK prohibits the use of TLS versions prior to 1.2 unless the connection is made to an Active Directory Rights Management server.

## Cryptographic Algorithms in MIP SDK

| Algorithm | Key Length        | Mode     | Comment                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------- | ----------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AES       | 128, 192, 256-bit | ECB, CBC | MIP SDK always protects by default with AES256 CBC. Legacy versions of Office (2010) require AES 128 ECB, and Office docs are still protected in this manner by Office apps. |
| RSA       | 2048-bit          | n/a      | Used for signing and protecting session key that protects a symmetric key blob.                                                                               |
| SHA-1     | n/a               | n/a      | Hash algorithm used in signature validation for legacy publishing licenses.                                                                                             |
| SHA-256   | n/a               | n/a      | Hash algorithm used in data validation, signature validation, and as database keys.                                                                                     |
