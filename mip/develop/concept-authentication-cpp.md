# Microsoft Information Protection SDK - Authentication concepts

Authentication in the MIP SDK is performed by extending the class `mip::AuthDelegate` to implement your preferred method of authentication. `mip::AuthDelegate` contains:

- `mip::AuthDelegate::OAuth2Challenge` - a class that manages the OAuth2 authority info and provides to the client application.
- `mip::AuthDelegate::OAuth2Token` - a class manages OAuth2 access token acquisition (from the client application) and token storage.
- `mip::AuthDelegate::AcquireOAuth2Token()` - a pure virtual function, whose implementation determines the method of access token acquisition. After being called by the SDK, it acquires the access token, then provides it back to the SDK's authentication logic.

`mip::AuthDelegate::AcquireOAuth2Token` accepts the following parameters, and returns a bool indicating whether token acquisition was successful:

- `mip::Identity`: The identity of the user or service to be authenticated, if known.
- `mip::AuthDelegate::OAuth2Challenge`: Accepts four parameters, **authority**, **resource**, **claims**, and **scopes**. **Authority** is the service the token will be generated against. **Resource** is the service we're trying to access. The SDK will handle passing these parameters into the delegate when called. **Claims** are the label-specific claims required by the protection service. **Scopes** are the Azure AD permission scopes required to access the resource. 
- `mip::AuthDelegate::OAuth2Token`: The token result is written to this object. It will be consumed by the SDK when the engine is loaded. Outside of our authentication implementation, it shouldn't be necessary to get or set this value anywhere.

**Important:** Applications don't call `AcquireOAuth2Token` directly. The SDK will call this function when required.

## Consent

Azure AD requires an application to be given consent, before it is granted permission to access secured resources/APIs under the identity of an account. Consent is recorded as a permanent acknowledgment of permission in the tenant of the account, for the specific account (user consent) or all accounts (admin consent). Consent occurs in various scenarios, based on the API being accessed and permissions the application is seeking, and the account used for sign-in: 

- accounts from the *same tenant* where your application is registered, if you or an administrator didn't explicitly pre-consent access via the "Grant Permissions" feature.
- accounts from a *different tenant* if your application is registered as multi-tenant, and the tenant administrator hasn't pre-consented for all users in advance.

The `mip::Consent` enum class implements an easy-to-use approach that permits application developers to provide a custom consent experience based on the endpoint that is being accessed by the SDK. The notification can inform a user of the data that will be collected, how to get the data removed, or any other information that is required by law or compliance policies. Once the user grants consent, the application can continue. 

### Implementation

Consent is implemented by extending the `mip::Consent` base class and implementing `GetUserConsent` to return one of the `mip::Consent` enum values. 

The object derived from `mip::Consent` is passed in to the `mip::FileProfile::Settings` or `mip::ProtectionProfile::Settings` constructor.

When a user performs an operation that would require providing consent, the SDK calls the `GetUserConsent` method, passing in the destination URL as the parameter. It's in this method where one would implement displaying the necessary information to the user, allowing them to make a decision on whether or not they consent to using the service. 

### Consent Options

- **AcceptAlways**: Consent and remember the decision.
- **Accept**: Consent once.
- **Reject**: Do not consent.

When the SDK requests user consent with this method, the client
application should present the URL to the user. Client applications should
provide some means of obtaining user consent and return the appropriate
Consent enum that corresponds to the user's decision.

### Sample implementation

#### consent_delegate_impl.h

```cpp
class ConsentDelegateImpl final : public mip::ConsentDelegate {
public:
  ConsentDelegateImpl() = default;
  
  virtual mip::Consent GetUserConsent(const std::string& url) override;

};
```

#### consent_delegate_impl.cpp

When the SDK requires consent, the `GetUserConsent` method is called *by the SDK*, and the URL is passed in as a parameter. In the sample below, the user is notified that the SDK will connect to that provided URL and provides the user with an option on the commandline. Based on the choice by the user, the user accepts or rejects consent and that is passed to the SDK. If the user declines to consent the application will throw an exception and no call is made to the protection service. 

```cpp
Consent ConsentDelegateImpl::GetUserConsent(const string& url) {
  //Print the consent URL, ask user to choose
  std::cout << "SDK will connect to: " << url << std::endl;

  std::cout << "1) Accept Always" << std::endl;
  std::cout << "2) Accept" << std::endl;
  std::cout << "3) Reject" << std::endl;
  std::cout << "Select an option: ";
  char input;
  std::cin >> input;

  switch (input)
  {
  case '1':
    return Consent::AcceptAlways;
    break;
  case '2':
    return Consent::Accept;
    break;
  case '3':
    return Consent::Reject;
    break;
  default:
    return Consent::Reject;
  }  
}
```

For testing and development purposes, a simple `ConsentDelegate` can be implemented that looks like:

```cpp
Consent ConsentDelegateImpl::GetUserConsent(const string& url) {
  return Consent::AcceptAlways;
}
```

However, in production code the user may be required to be presented with a choice to consent, depending on regional or business requirements and regulations. 

## Next steps

For simplicity, samples demonstrating the delegate will implement token acquisition by calling an external script. This script can be replaced by any other type of script, an open-source OAuth2 library, or a custom OAuth2 library.
