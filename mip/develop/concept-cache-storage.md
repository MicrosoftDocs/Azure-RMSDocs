# Microsoft Information Protection SDK - Cache storage

The MIP SDK implements a SQLite3 database for maintaining SDK cache storage. Prior to version 1.3 of the Microsoft Information Protection SDK, only two types of cache state storage were supported: On disk and in memory. Both of these types stored certain data, specifically licenses for protected content and policy information, in plaintext.

To improve the security posture of the SDK, we added support for a second type of on disk cache that uses platform-specific cryptographic APIs to protect the database and its contents.

The application defines the cache type when loading the profile as part of the `FileProfileSettings`, `PolicyProfileSettings`, or `ProtectionProfileSettings` objects. The cache type is static for the life of the profile. Changing to a different type of cache storage type requires destroying the existing profile and creating a new one.

## Cache Storage Types

Starting in MIP SDK release 1.3, the following storage cache types are available.

| Type            | Purpose                                                                                                                         |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| InMemory        | Maintains the storage cache in memory in the application.                                                                       |
| OnDisk          | Stores the database on disk in the directory provided in the settings object. The database is stored in plaintext.              |
| OnDiskEncrypted | Stores the database on disk in the directory provided in the settings object. The database is encrypted using OS-specific APIs. |

Each **engine** generated by the application will generate a new encryption key.

Cache storage is set via one of the profile settings objects, through the `mip::CacheStorageType` enum.

```cpp 
FileProfile::Settings profileSettings(mMipContext,
    mip::CacheStorageType::OnDiskEncrypted, // Define the storage type to use.
    mAuthDelegate,
    std::make_shared<sample::consent::ConsentDelegateImpl>(),
    std::make_shared<FileProfileObserver>());
```

## When to use each type

Cache storage is important for maintaining offline access to previously-decrypted information, as well as ensuring performance for decryption operations when data has been previously consumed.

- **In Memory Storage**: Use this storage type for long-lived processes where persisting the policy or license cache information across service restarts is not required.
- **On Disk**: Use this storage type for applications where processes may frequently stop and start, but must maintain policy, license, and service discovery cache across restarts. This storage cache type is plaintext, so is better suited for server workloads where users won't have access to the state storage. Examples of this would be a Windows service or Linux daemon running on a server, or a SaaS application where only service admins would have access to the state data.
- **On Disk and Encrypted**: Use this storage type for applications where processes may frequently stop and start, but must maintain policy, license, and service discovery cache across restarts. This storage cache is encrypted, so is better suited for workstation applications where a user may browse and discover the state database. The encryption helps to ensure that prying users won't have access to via the policy contents or protection license content in plain text. It's important to note that in all cases the data is encrypted with keys that the user may be able to access. A skilled adversary will be able to decrypt the cache with minimal effort, but this does prevent tampering and browsing.

## Supported Platforms for Encryption

| Platform          | Version                | Notes                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Microsoft Windows | Windows 8 and newer    | Windows 7 supports only CacheStorageType::OnDisk                                                                                    |
| macOS             | High Sierra and later  |                                                                                                                                     |
| Ubuntu Linux      | 16.04 and later        | Requires [SecretService](https://developer.gnome.org/libsecret/unstable/SecretService.html) and `LinuxEncryptedCache` feature flag. |
| Android           | Android 7.0 or later   |                                                                                                                                     |
| iOS               | All supported versions |                                                                                                                                     |

While the MIP SDK does support other Linux distributions, we didn't test the cache encryption on RedHat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, or Debian.

> [!NOTE]
> The feature flag to enable cache storage on Linux is set via `mip::MipContext::CreateWithCustomFeatureSettings()`

## Cache storage database tables

The MIP SDK maintains two databases for cache. One is for the protection APIs, and maintaining protection state details. The other is for the policy APIs and maintaining policy details and service information. Both are stored in the path defined in the settings object, under **mip\mip.policies.sqlite3** and **mip\mip.protection.sqlite3**.

### Protection Database

| Table         | Purpose                                                        | Encrypted |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| AuthInfoStore | Stores authentication challenge details.                       | No        |
| ConsentStore  | Stores consent results for each engine.                        | No        |
| DnsInfoStore  | Stores DNS lookup results for SDK protection operations        | No        |
| EngineStore   | Stores engine details, associated user, and custom client data | No        |
| KeyStore      | Stores symmetric encryption keys for each engine.              | Yes       |
| LicenseStore  | Stores use license information for previously decrypted data.  | Yes       |
| SdInfoStore   | Stores service discovery results.                              | No        |

### Policy Database

| Table           | Purpose                                                          | Encrypted |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| KeyStore        | Stores symmetric encryption keys for each engine.                | Yes       |
| Policies        | Stores label policy information for each user.                   | Yes       |
| PoliciesUrl     | Stores backend policy service URL for specific user.             | No        |
| Sensitivity     | Stores classification rules for a specific user policy.          | Yes       |
| SensitivityUrls | Stores backend sensitivity policy service URL for specific user. | Yes       |

## Database size considerations

The database size depends on two factors: The quantity of engines being added to the cache and the quantity of protection licenses that have been cached. As of MIP SDK 1.3, there is no mechanism to clean up the license cache as they expire. There will have to be an external process to remove the cache if it grows larger than is desired.

The most significant contributor to database growth will be the protection license cache. If licensing caching isn't required, either because the service round trips won't impact your application performance, or the cache may grow too large, the license cache can be disable. This is accomplished by setting `CanCacheLicenses` on the `FileProfile::Settings` object to false.

```cpp
FileProfile::Settings profileSettings(mMipContext,
    mip::CacheStorageType::OnDiskEncrypted,
    mAuthDelegate,
    std::make_shared<sample::consent::ConsentDelegateImpl>(),
    std::make_shared<FileProfileObserver>());

profileSettings.SetCanCacheLicenses(false);
```
