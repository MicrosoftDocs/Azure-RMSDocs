# Concept - Logging in MIP SDK
Troubleshooting custom applications that consume the MIP SDK begin with inspecting mip logs. MIP log location is configured at [MipContext](/information-protection/develop/concept-mipcontext#mipcontext) creation and can be queried for with *.miplog file extension.
Microsoft apps and samples store MIP logs at <application path>\APP_DATA\mip_data.

## Mask sensitive data in MIP logs
Logs in the MIP SDK do not mask sensitive content which may be personally identifiable to a customer without extra configuration. 

What sensitive data is most common in the MIP SDK?
- Email names
- File names
- Label names
- IP addresses
- MAC addresses

To mask sensitive content in all .miplog files generated by the MIP SDK, create a new field in the configuration .json file or configure in MipConfiguration.

## Configuration file
Configuration files are the recommended path to configure custom settings in the MIP SDK and available on all supported platforms.

Create a configuration file accessible by the MIP SDK for custom settings called `mip_config.json` and store the file in the following [MipConfiguration](/information-protection/develop/concept-mipcontext?branch=main#creating-mipconfiguration) path.
```cpp
mipConfiguration->GetPath()/mip
```
Add a new field to `mip_config.json` to set the `AllowPii` field to false.

```json
{"MipLogger":{"MaxLogFilesSizeMb":40,"MaxLogFileCount":10,"AllowPii":false}}
```
Once configured, sensitive content is masked in all new MIP logs generated by the MIP SDK.

## Configure in MipConfiguration
Create a new `MipConfiguration` object to pass into `MipContext` with new values for the custom settings.

This method is supported for C++ and C# only. Developers using the C API or Java wrappers are recommended to create a configuration file instead.
```cpp
auto mipConfiguration = make_shared<mip::MipConfiguration>(appInfo, "mip_data", mip::LogLevel::Trace, false);
    auto loggerConfiguration = make_shared<mip::LoggerConfiguration>();
    loggerConfiguration->isPiiAllowed = false;
    mipConfiguration->SetLoggerConfiguration(loggerConfiguration);
    auto mipContext = MipContext::Create(mipConfiguration);
```
```csharp
MipConfiguration mipConfiguration = new MipConfiguration(appInfo, "mip_data", LogLevel.Trace, false);
  mipConfiguration.LoggerConfigurationOverride = new LoggerConfiguration(10, 40, false);
  var mipContext = MIP.CreateMipContext(mipConfiguration);
```
