## Version 1.11.53

**Release Date** November 17, 2021

### File SDK

- Fixed bug where IsModified() in mip::FileHandler returns false instead of true for a plaintext .MSG file with protected attachment.
- Fixed bug Addressing XML formatting issues in metadata that broke labels with no protection in certain cases.

### Policy SDK

- Introduced improvements to prevent deadlocking in Policy Sync.

### Breaking Changes

- Previously, when a label was configured for "Do Not Forward" or "Encrypt Only" and a file protection action, MIP SDK would not display the label in the label list for the file content type.
  - The SDK has been updated to fix this issue. The label will not be filtered in either case when configured to apply to both content types.
  - This change does not impact labels where the protection action was "Encrypt Only" or "Do Not Forward".
  - Lastly, it doesn’t impact labels intended for files where the action was predefined or user-defined protection.

- Updated existing exceptions for better handling of specific scenarios. The following previously surfaced as `NetworkError::Category::FailureResponseCode`
  - `NetworkError::Category::ServiceUnavailable`
    - New exception category (`NetworkError` exception).
    - Returned when the dependent service is unavailable.
    - Service returns 503
  - `NetworkError::Category::Throttled`
    - Exception: `NetworkError`
    - Returned when too many requests have been made to the dependent service.
    - Service returns 429

### Platform and Dependency Updates

- Updated SDK dependencies to latest versions
- All MIP SDK binaries have been updated to use version 2.9.12 of libxml2 static library and libgsf dynamic library for Android and Windows.
- Proxy support for Linux introduced. Example of how to set proxy below.

```bash
export HTTP_PROXY="http://10.10.10.10:8080"
```

## Version 1.10.98

**Release Date** September 29, 2021

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug in iOS where bitcode was not enabled

## Version 1.10.97

**Release date:** September 17, 2021

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug where attachments on MSG files were corrupted when applying a protection label to the MSG file.

## Version 1.10.93

**Release date:** August 23, 2021

### General Changes

- Added `MipConfiguration` class.
  - This class controls the configuration settings previously set directly on MipContext.
  - Delegates, logging location, etc. are set as part of this object.
  - Review [MipContext Concepts](concept-mipcontext.md) for details.
- `MipContext::Create()` constructor has been changed to accept only the new `MipConfiguration` object.
  - Review [MipContext Concepts](concept-mipcontext.md) for details.
- All engine settings will default to en-US locale in the event that the `.Locale` property is set to `null`.
- Fixed an issue where the SDK wasn't fully honoring the logging level settings.

### File SDK

- Added support for reading and writing labels to MSG files.
  - The pattern for labeling this files is that same as any other file type.
  - The **enable_msg_file_type** custom setting must be set to enable MSG file handling.
  - Attachments will be protected but **not** labeled.
  - Review [Set enable_msg_file_type and use File SDK for protecting .msg file](quick-email-msg-csharp.md#set-enable_msg_file_type-and-use-file-sdk-for-labeling-msg-file) for details on custom setting.
- `FileHandler::IsLabeledOrProtected()` now supports MSG files.
- File SDK now supports decryption of protected attachments on unprotected MSG files.
  - This applies only to files and not containers such as MSG or ZIP files.
- Added new static method `mip::FileHandler::GetFileStatus()`
  - This function returns a new `mip::FileStatus` object that indicates whether the file is labeled, protected, or contains protected objects. 
  - `FileStatus` exposes three properties: `IsProtected`, `IsLabeled`, and `ContainsProtectedObjects`.
  - `ContainsProtectedObjects` is useful for MSG files that have protected attachments.
- When calling `FileHandler::RemoveProtection()` on a plaintext MSG file with protected attachments, protection will be removed from the attachments.
- Fixed a bug where `IProtectionHandler` was destroyed when calling `IFileHandler.SetProtection()` in a loop. `IProtectionHandler` instance will no longer be destroyed after use. 

### Policy SDK

- The content marking variable `${Event.DateTime}` now defaults to local time rather than UTC.
  - This can be set back to the previous default by using flighting feature `EventDateTimeTokenUseUtc`.
- Fixed bug where `IsActive` was not returning the same values inside a `PolicyHandler` as it was when retrieving labels from a `PolicyEngine`.

### Protection SDK

- Added new more specific error types that will surface in both Protection and File SDK. See Breaking Changes section.

### Breaking Changes

- Introduced new custom settings to govern the default audit settings.
  - Added new property in audit Delegate to set audit settings.
  - `LabelGroupData` class no longer has `IsAuditEnabled()` method. 
  - You can use instead `GetEnableAuditSetting()` to get `EnableAudit` settings in the policy once policy is loaded. Default audit settings will be `Undefined` as oppose to `true` in older versions. 
- Allow passing the document's timezone to ComputeActions to allow actions to be computed as if the document existed in a different timezone from the machine applying the label. 
  - Useful for when labels are applied on behalf of a user through a service, where the server's local time is not necessarily the same as the user's.
  - Instead of returning the `${Event.DateTime}` in UTC format, we now default to local time without displaying the timezone.
- Updated existing exceptions for better handling of specific scenarios.
  - `NoPermissionsError::Category::NotPremiumLicenseUser`
    - Previously surfaced as `NoPermissionsError::Category::AccessDenied`
    - Caused by an unlicensed user attempting to revoke protected content. 
  - `NoPermissionsError::Category::NotOwner`
    - Previously surfaced as `NoPermissionsError::Category::AccessDenied`
    - Caused by a user attempting to revoke a document they don't own.
  - `ServiceDisabledError::Extent::Tenant`
    - Previously surfaced as `ServiceDisabledError::Extent::User`
    - Returned when the targeted Azure Rights Management service instead is disabled. 
  - `NoPermissionsError::Category::AccessDenied`
    - Previously surfaced as `NetworkError::Category::FailureResponseCode`
    - Returned when the user has no rights to publish due to licensing or onboarding controls.
  - `BadInputError::ErrorCode::DoubleKey`
    - Previously surfaced as `NetworkError::Category::FailureResponseCode`
    - Returned when Double Key Encryption (DKE) parameters are incorrect. 
  - `CustomerKeyUnavailableError`
    - New exception.
    - Returned when the tenant is configured for bring-your-own-key (BYOK) and the key cannot be reached. 
    - Service returns HTTP424. 
  - `NetworkError::Category::FunctionNotImplemented`
    - New exception.
    - Returned when service returned HTTP501 (Not Implemented).
  - The following previously surfaced as `NetworkError::Category::FailureResponseCode`
    - `TemplateArchivedError`: The application attempted to apply a template ID that has been archived.  
    - `LicenseNotRegisteredError`: The document publishing license is not registered for revocation. 
    - `NoPermissionsError::Category::UserNotFound`: The provided user doesn't exist in the target tenant. 
    - `NoPermissionsError::Category::InvalidEmail`: An invalid email address was provided. 
    - `NoPermissionsError::Category::AccessDenied`: The provided identity is not a principal recognized by RMS or isn't a valid delegator.
    - `BadInputError::ErrorCode::LicenseNotTrusted`: The provided publishing license isn't from a trusted publisher. (Not in C API)
    - `BadInputError::ErrorCode::ParameterParsing`: Returned by various XML, JSON, or other parsing issues (Not in C API)

## Version 1.9.78

**Release date:** April 29, 2021

### General Changes

- Added a new parameter that allows developers to provide custom scenario IDs for correlating errors. 
  - In the event that a support case is required to diagnose a service-side error, this scenario ID may be helpful in troubleshooting. 
  - **File SDK**: When creating a `FileHandler` set the applicationScenarioID via `FileExecutionState`
  - **Protection SDK**: Various APIs now support passing in the scenario ID. 
    - `mip::ProtectionCommonSettings(mApplicationScenarioId)`

- Added support for redirecting protection requests via `ProtectionProfile::Settings::AddRedirectionUri()`
- Added a logger context that can be used with `LoggerDelegate` to write custom context data through to logs.
  - This API can be useful for correlating error events in services to a single operation or events. 
  - The following APIs support providing the logger context:
    - `LoggerDelegate::WriteToLogWithContext`
    - `TaskDispatcherDelegate::DispatchTask` or `ExecuteTaskOnIndependentThread`    
    - `FileEngine::Settings::SetLoggerContext(const std::shared_ptr<void>& loggerContext)`

It is now mandatory that in addition to configuring the service-side components of the AIP Analytics feature that you also set the EnableAudit property to true in sensitivity label policies. 
  - `Set-LabelPolicy -Identity Global -AdvancedSettings @{EnableAudit="True"}`
  - Review [this](/azure/information-protection/rms-client/clientv2-admin-guide-customizations#configuring-advanced-settings-for-the-client-via-powershell) Docs article for details on setting advanced policy settings.  
- Added function `GetApplicationScenarioId()` to `FileExecutionState`.
- Removed `ContentFormat` enum.
- Added specific errors with categories for a set of errors exposed previously under `NetworkError` via strings/error codes.
  - `NoPermissionsError::Category::UserNotFound`
  - `NoPermissionsError::Category::AccessDenied`
  - `NoPermissionsError::Category::AccessExpired`
  - `NoPermissionsError::Category::UserNotFound`
- `Microsoft.RightsManagement.Exceptions.UnknownTenantException` thrown service will now surface as `ServiceDisabledError` instead of `Network Error`
  
### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a memory leak when calling `mip::FileHandler::IsLabeledOrProtected()`.
- Fixed a bug where failure in `FileHandler::InspectAsync()` called incorrect observer.
- Fixed a bug where SDK attempted to apply co-authoring label format to Office formats that don't support co-authoring (DOC, PPT, XLS).
- Fixed a crash in the .NET wrapper related to `FileEngine` disposal. Native `PolicyEngine` object remained present for some period and would attempt a policy refresh, resulting in a crash. 
- Fixed a bug where the SDK would ignore labels applied by older versions of AIP due to missing **SiteID** property.

## Version 1.8.97

**Release date:** February 24, 2021

- Fixed a bug where child labels were not filtered properly and included all types of labels, even if not requested. 
- Fixed a bug where labels weren't maintained on `RemoveProtection()` if label metadata was incomplete. 

## Version 1.8.94

**Release date:** February 8, 2021

- Fixed bug in NuGet package where debug configuration for C++ projects deployed release binaries. Version 1.8.86 may result in a crash with native C++ apps. Make sure to update to 1.8.94 or later.
- Fixed a bug where policy engine was required to remove protection. 
  - If policy engine can't be loaded and label metadata is present, it will be discarded if protection is removed. 
- Fixed a bug where empty `labelInfo.xml` was generated if file was changed to another protected label. 

## Version 1.8.86

**Release date:** January 13, 2021

### General Changes

- Added support for Mac on ARM.
- Signed all dylib files for Mac.
- All clouds are fully supported across all three SDKs.
- Rename `TelemetryConfiguration` to `DiagnosticConfiguration`.
- Updated `MipContext` to accept `DiagnosticConfiguration` instead of `TelemetryConfiguration`.
- Exposed new `AuditDelegate`.
- Several custom settings have had their name changed and will be removed in version 1.9. These will continue to function in parallel with their updates names in version 1.8. 

| New Name          | Old Name                   |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- |
| is_debug_audit    | is_debug_telemetry         |
| is_audit_disabled | is_built_in_audit_disabled |

### File SDK

- Added support for user-defined labels with double key encryption.
- Added an API, `MsgInspector.BodyType` to expose body encoding type for MSG files.
- Added APIs to support Double Key Encryption with User-Defined Permissions.
- Added flag for `mip::FileHandler` that will allow the caller to disable audit discover event send. This fixes a scenario where using the `ClassifyAsync()` API would result in duplicate discovery events.
- Fixed bugs where: 
  - Setting protection on XPS file fails.
  - A file cannot be opened after upload/download from SharePoint Online and removing custom permissions.
  - `RemoveProtection()` function would accept a message.rpmsg input. Now accepts only MSG files.
  - A crash that occurred when attempting to track or revoke unprotected files.

### Policy SDK

- Removed `ActionId` from default metadata properties to ensure consistency between Microsoft Office and SharePoint Online labeled documents.
- Added support for Azure Purview-specific labels.
- Added ability to override both telemetry and audit via delegates for each.
  - Audit delegate provides the ability to send AIP auditing events to a destination other than AIP Analytics, or in addition to AIP Analytics.
- Added flag for `mip::PolicyHandler` that will allow the caller to discover audit discover event send. This fixes a scenario where using the `ClassifyAsync()` API would result in duplicate discovery events.
- Fixed a bug where encrypted policy database couldn't be opened in certain scenarios.
- Exposed new `AuditDelegate` that allows developers to override default MIP SDK audit pipeline and send events to their own infrastructure. 
- `mip::ClassifierUniqueIdsAndContentFormats` and `GetContentFormat()` now return `std::string` instead of `mip::ContentFormat`. This change is replicated in .NET and Java wrappers. 
- `ContentFormat.Default` is now `ContentFormat.File`.

### Protection SDK

- Added a `ProtectionEngineSettings.SetAllowCloudServiceOnly` property that will prohibit any connections to Active Directory Rights Management Services clusters when true. Only cloud environments will be used.
- Added support for acquiring delegation licenses.
  - Delegations licenses enable services to fetch a license for content on behalf of a user.
  - This lets the service view rights data and decrypt on behalf of the user without additional calls to service.  

### Java Wrapper (Public Preview)

- Added support for Track and Revoke to Java Wrapper.
- Added stream support to Java Wrapper

### C API

- Removed **MIP_FLIGHTING_FEATURE_KEEP_PDF_LINEARIZATION** flag from C API.

We found that customers deploying .NET solutions in debug mode to remote servers were required to install the VC++ Debug runtime, which isn't trivial. If there's a need to debug in to native libraries, please copy the DLLs from the SDK redistributable into the project folder (https://ala.ms/mipsdkbins)
- Fixed a bug that was generating warnings for .NET Core projects.

  - Change made due to decryption of large files requiring *at least* the file size in available memory.
  - Can be overridden by custom setting `max_file_size_for_protection`.
- Added support for linearized PDFs.
- Fixed a bug where LastModifiedDate wasn't updated on Change event.
- Fixed a memory leak in protected PDF creation.

  - `ContentLabel::GetExtendedProperties` now returns `vector<MetadataEntry>` instead of `vector<pair<string, string>>`.
  - `MetadataAction::GetMetadataToAdd` now returns `vector<MetadataEntry>` instead of `vector<pair<string, string>>`.
  - `ExecutionState::GetContentMetadata` should now return `vector<MetadataEntry>` instead of `vector<pair<string, string>>`.
  - `ExecutionState::GetContentMetadataVersion` should return the highest version of metadata that the application recognizes for the current file format (usually 0).
